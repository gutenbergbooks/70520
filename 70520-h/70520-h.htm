THE SEVENTEENTH EDITION.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
If when this book was first written the Author
could say that the "signs of the times pointed
strongly towards the Holy Land and the once
glorious city of Jerusalem, and that the eyes of
many&mdash;both Jews and Gentiles&mdash;were turned
thither in anxious expectation," how much more
emphatically may the same assertion now be made!
</p>

<p>
The interest felt for God's ancient people, the
Jews, has been gradually increasing; and their
condition, as a people, has been greatly improved.
Many decrees have been passed in their favour in
various lands; and in few civilized countries are
they now subjected to either persecution or
contumely.  Moreover, the hearts of multitudes of
Christians are awakened to feelings of love and
sympathy towards their elder brethren of the Jewish
Church: the servants of Christ "think upon the
stones of Jerusalem, and it pitieth them to see her
in the dust."
</p>

<p>
All this, combined with many other circumstances
to which the attention of the world has been called
of late years, leads us to hope that as the threatened
<i>judgments</i> of the Lord have been awfully accomplished
in the dispersion of his chosen people, his
promises for their restoration may ere long be found
equally sure.  We know that there is a "<i>tribulation</i>&mdash;the
<i>great one</i>"&mdash;yet to be brought on the land of
Israel, and on her gathered population; but that
will usher in their final glory and redemption.
Then the same Almighty power which has turned
the fruitful field into a "desolate wilderness," will
cause that "wilderness" to "blossom as the rose;"
and the same hand that once scattered the Jews
over the face of the world, and made them a proverb
and a by-word to the Gentile nations, will "bring
them again to their own land," and make them the
"joy of the whole earth."
</p>

<p>
While we contemplate the present fallen condition
of the children of Israel, and the desolate state in
which their "good land"&mdash;once "flowing with milk
and honey"&mdash;is still lying, our minds naturally
revert to their former glory, and the unexampled
prosperity with which they were blessed: and we
ask <i>wherefore</i> they have thus been degraded from
their high position?  God's word gives the
answer&mdash;"Because they rebelled against the Lord, and
lightly regarded the judgments of the Most High:"
and, believing that such considerations may be both
interesting and profitable to young readers, the
Author ventured&mdash;with a full sense of her own
incompetence to do justice to the subject&mdash;to
attempt a narrative, the scene of which is chiefly
laid in Jerusalem; and the period it embraces is one
of the most eventful and calamitous that has ever
been detailed in history.  It may be thought that
the circumstances of horror and bloodshed have
been dwelt on with too much minuteness; but let
it be remembered that all the events here related,
and many others far more appalling, did actually
take place when God avenged himself on his
rebellious people: and let it further be remembered,
that these things were intended not only for the
chastisement of the Jews, but also for the warning
of the Gentiles.
</p>

<p>
We know, from the declaration of Christ himself,
that a <i>greater tribulation</i> is yet to come on the earth.
God grant that we may be warned in time, and
prepared to meet it!  May we be among those
blessed servants of the Lord for whom a surer
refuge&mdash;a more glorious Pella&mdash;will be provided in
that day, that so we may "escape those things
that are coming on the earth, and stand before the
Son of Man!"
</p>

<p>
The Author cannot forbear here expressing her
sense of the favour and indulgence with which her
attempt to portray "the last days of Jerusalem"
has been hitherto received; and her earnest hope
that it may have led some of her readers to feel a
greater interest in the Jews, and to "pray for the
peace of Jerusalem."  Let us pray also for their
conversion, and their preparation to meet their
expected Messiah: for thus shall we be exercising
the highest duties of Christian charity, and
repaying in the best manner our obligations to those
unto whom the promises of God were first made,
and "from whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ
came."

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
</h3>

<p>
The sun was slowly sinking behind the lofty buildings
which crowned the hill of Zion, and its departing beams
were glowing on the marble walls and golden pinnacles of
the Temple, when young Naomi and her friend Claudia
came forth from the dwelling of Zadok the priest, and
wandered down the lovely little stream of Siloë.  They
passed through the Water Gate, and entered a garden
of luxuriant fruit-trees, which extended to the margin of
the brook Kedron on the east, while its southern boundary
was watered by Siloë's rippling waves, which flowed into
the Kedron at that spot.  Here the two maidens seated
themselves, to enjoy the balmy freshness of an evening
in an eastern clime, and to gaze upon the glorious city
which lay before them, now hushed in silence as the day
declined, and the clear blue vault of heaven that stretched
without a cloud above their heads.
</p>

<p>
"Naomi," said Claudia, "how sweetly the peaceful
silence of this quiet spot comes over my soul, after the
noise and tumult of the day!  When my father sent me
from the Roman camp, to take refuge with you in your
Holy City, I hoped to have found safety and tranquillity,
but instead of the calm cheerfulness which reigned within
these walls in former years, when I spent so much of my
happy childhood with you, I now find nothing but discord
and rebellion; and instead of the sweet sounds of
the timbrel and pipe, I hear the din of war, the clashing
of arms, and the trampling march of soldiers in their
military exercises.  My spirit sinks when I look forward
to the scenes we may yet witness.  Our legions will surely
turn their march towards Jerusalem, when the conquest
of the cities of Galilee is completed; and what can your
troops, though brave, hope to do, when opposed to the
soldiers of Vespasian? or how will your gates and boasted
walls be able to stand against the powerful engines of the
Romans?"
</p>

<p>
"We fear them not, Claudia," replied the high-spirited
young Jewess, and her bright black eyes flashed as she
spoke; "we fear them not: Never shall our holy and
beautiful city be given into the hands of those fierce and
cruel idolaters.  Forgive me, dear Claudia, but though
they are your countrymen, and you have been brought
up in their impious religion, I cannot forbear expressing
my firm conviction that the God of our fathers will yet
preserve us from these Gentiles, nor suffer the house
where He has placed his name to be again trampled on
and defiled by those who know him not."
</p>

<p>
"I forgive you, Naomi; indeed, I love to see you when
these proud thoughts fill your breast.  You look like our
majestic goddess Minerva, and only want a panoply of
mail to personate her well.  My heart is of a different
mould to yours; and I admire your spirit, though I
cannot emulate it.  You should have been born a Roman,
and you would have rivalled any of our heroines of old."
</p>

<p>
"Better far to be a daughter of Israel," replied Naomi.
"Better far to be one of God's own people, though now
for our sins we are degraded and in sorrow, than to
belong to that nation who are employed in the hand of
Jehovah to chastise his chosen race!  Soon will He, for
whom we wait in eager expectation, appear in the clouds
in glory, and rescue his children from all those that
oppress them.  Then shall the people who worship stocks
and stones be driven away before the brightness of his
coming, and his own adopted children be exalted for
ever!"
</p>

<p>
The colour mounted into the usually pale cheeks of
Naomi, as she thus expressed her own enthusiastic
feelings, while her eyes were fixed on the darkening sky
above her, and her hands upraised, as if even then she
awaited the sound of the trumpet, and the vision of the
Messiah coming in the air.  The expectation of his
immediate appearance was, at that period, very widely
diffused and strongly felt by the Jews; and it is supposed
that this vain hope had greatly encouraged them in their
revolt, and obstinate resistance against the power of the
Romans.  They entertained a firm conviction that their
great Deliverer would shortly be manifested to his people,
and that although for a time their oppressors had been
permitted to triumph over them, yet their destruction as
a people would never take place; and that in their hour
of greatest extremity their King and Saviour would appear,
to re-establish the throne of his father David, and
to raise their nation to a glory and prosperity surpassing
that of Solomon.
</p>

<p>
Claudia was impressed by the vehemence of her
friend's manner; but she regarded all her hopes as vain
delusions, and, after a pause, she replied:
</p>

<p>
"Naomi, your wild religion blinds and deceives you,
and in these visionary expectations you forget the danger
of the present time.  Instead of indulging in such idle
dreams, your wisest course would be, to use all your
influence in persuading your father to abandon this city
while yet there is time, and throw himself on the clemency
of Vespasian.  Zadok's character stands high, both among
the Romans and his own people, for wisdom, integrity,
and courage; and if he were to take so prudent a step,
and recommend it to his countrymen, his example would
probably be followed by many, if not all; and oh!  Naomi,
what bloodshed and misery would be averted!  Your
nation would be restored to peace and security, and
plenty would again be seen in those districts which our
legions have already reduced to desolation.  Had you
witnessed all the horrors of war and massacre that I have
done, I think even your courage would shrink from
drawing such fearful calamities upon your beloved city.
My blood curdles when I remember the miseries of which
I was an unwilling spectator, while I accompanied my
father in Vespasian's camp.  Truly I believe the sight
of sufferings which she could not relieve, added to the
fatigue and constant excitement of our military life,
hastened the death of my dear mother.  Would that the
gods had permitted her and me to remain in Jerusalem
when my father was called to join the army!  Then I
should not thus early have had to weep over her grave:
but it was her fate, and I must submit."
</p>

<p>
The tears rolled down the fair countenance of Claudia
as she spoke of her beloved mother, and ineffectually
sought consolation for her death in the cold maxims of
philosophy, which were all that the heathen system of
religion could afford her.  Naomi endeavoured, as she had
often done before, to awaken in her dark mind the belief
in one Almighty God, by whose superintending Providence
all events are governed; but her friend was too
firmly convinced of the truth of her own religion to be
thus easily shaken, or induced to listen to the despised
doctrines of a Jew; she therefore hastily resumed the
subject of the war, and, in spite of Naomi's indignant replies,
continued to urge upon her the necessity of submission to
the overwhelming and resistless power of Rome.
</p>

<p>
"Claudia," said Naomi at length, rising from her
mossy seat, and extending her hand towards the lofty
walls and towers of the city, now dark in the shades of
evening; "Claudia, I would rather, oh! ten thousand
times rather perish beneath those sacred walls, if it be
the will of Jehovah that the spoiler should again possess
them, than live to see my people once more subject to
the Roman power.  We have nobly shaken it off, and
never till we are exterminated will we cease to resist their
oppressions, and assert our freedom.  You wonder at my
enthusiasm, as you call it; but be assured the same spirit
animates every son and every daughter of Israel: and
when your proud legions advance beneath these impenetrable
walls, they will be received with such a welcome as
shall prove that in Jerusalem at least the soul of our
fathers still survives."
</p>

<p>
"May the gods preserve us from beholding the conflict!"
answered Claudia, with a shudder, as she rose to
accompany her friend towards their home: "I should
regret then that I had persuaded my father to send me
here, after my poor mother's death, instead of to Cæsarea,
as he proposed; but my heart was with you, Naomi, and
I felt that in your company, and that of your gentle
mother, I should find comfort in my sorrow.  My father's
strong regard and high esteem for Zadok induced him to
consent to my returning to your house, as your mother's
letter so kindly proposed; and at that time he had no
idea that the war would continue so long, or spread from
Galilee into Judea.  Should Vespasian bring his army
against Jerusalem&mdash;as my father's last letter seemed to
announce&mdash;he will of course send for me, and place me
at Cæsarea, with his friends who dwell there, and from
thence I could easily embark for Rome, and join my
brother Marcellus.  He has been residing in the capital
with our uncle Sulpitius ever since we left Jerusalem two
years ago; and he writes me glowing descriptions of the
splendour and magnificence of the imperial city.  You
know we were both so young when we came from our
native land to Judea, that we had forgotten all her glory
and beauty.  Marcellus tells me that he is very soon to
be enrolled among the emperor's troops, and then he will
probably be sent into this country, if the war is not
concluded.  Now I shall rejoice to see my dear, kind brother
again; and you too, Naomi, will not you welcome him?
You were always the greatest friends; and every letter
he writes is full of inquiries and kind messages to you.
But, alas! I forget myself.  If Marcellus comes to Judea,
it will probably be as the enemy of your land and people;
and this cruel war will separate those who have been
brought up together, and loved each other as brother
and sister from childhood."
</p>

<p>
Naomi was saved the embarrassment of a reply by
their reaching her father's house; and she was glad of
the circumstance, for the theme interested her feelings
more than she wished Claudia to discover.  Rufus the
centurion had resided for many years at Jerusalem,
holding a command in the imperial army, and his band
composing part of the guards stationed in the city.
Mutual obligations, and a respect for each other's
character, had created a sincere friendship between him and
Naomi's father Zadok, who, though he was a priest, and
devotedly attached to the Jewish faith, was not blind to
the generous and excellent qualities which distinguished
the Roman soldier.  Their families had constant intercourse,
and their children grew up together in habits of
familiar friendship.  Naomi and Claudia regarded each
other as sisters; nor did the difference of their religion
or the contrast in their dispositions ever cause a
disagreement between them.  Marcellus was their constant
companion, and their protector in their rambles among
the verdant hills, and luxurious meadows and gardens
which surrounded the city; and the mutual attachment
which grew up between him and Naomi was remarked
and smiled at by their parents while they were yet
children.  But as they advanced in years, it caused some
uneasiness to Zadok and his amiable wife Salome, who
could not allow themselves to contemplate the possibility
of a union between their beloved daughter and an idolater.
Nor was such an intention ever entertained by Naomi
her soul was peculiarly susceptible to feelings of piety,
and she worshipped the God of her fathers with a
sincerity and fervency of devotion which was not common
in the days of degeneracy and hypocrisy in which she
lived.  Idolatry she regarded with unfeigned abhorrence;
and while she loved her Roman friends with all the
natural warmth of an affectionate heart, she grieved for
their profane and impious creed, and many were the
attempts she made to convince them of its folly.  Hitherto
her efforts had been entirely unavailing, and she could
gain no further concession from her young companions
than an acknowledgment that Jehovah, the God of Israel,
might certainly be a <i>Deity</i>; but they looked upon him
merely as one of that host of deities in whom their
religion taught them to believe, and by no means superior
to their own false gods.  This being the case, Naomi
would have preferred death to a connexion with a Gentile
idolater; and she persuaded herself that her attachment
to Marcellus was nothing more than friendship.
</p>

<p>
When, however, Rufus and his family were called away
from Jerusalem, and his son was sent to Rome to perfect
his military education, she felt a void in her heart which
convinced her that she had allowed too much of her
happiness to depend on Marcellus, and she resolutely
determined to check every thought and extinguish every hope
that was connected with him.  At the time of which we
are now speaking he had been absent for two years; and
her praiseworthy efforts had been so far successful that
she had recovered her spirits, and entered into all her
duties and occupations with interest and animation.  She
was gifted with a strong mind, and a proud, independent
spirit, which enabled her to command her feelings to a
great degree; and even her mother, who was usually
her confident in all her joys and sorrows, believed that
she had entirely forgotten the brave and amiable young
Roman.
</p>

<p>
The return of her friend Claudia, to seek protection in
Zadok's house, when the death of her own mother rendered
it impossible for her to remain with Rufus in the camp,
a source of great delight to Naomi; but it revived
many recollections which she had long been endeavouring
to banish from her mind, and she found herself listening
with pleasure to Claudia's often-repeated praises of her
brother, and the kind messages which his letters
contained to herself; but she never spoke of him except as
the friend of her childhood, whom, in all probability, she
should never see again.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the contrast between Marcellus and her own
brother Javan had exalted the good qualities of the former
in her eyes.  Javan, even as a child, had manifested a
cruel and unhumbled disposition; and his domineering
spirit had been the frequent cause of disputes between
him and Marcellus, who invariably took the part of the
oppressed, and defended those whom Javan would have
annoyed or injured.  The affection which Naomi entertained
for Marcellus excited his jealousy and indignation;
and he often upbraided her with her friendship for
idolaters, and used very opprobrious language to the young
Roman himself, which, but for the interposition of their
sisters, would have ended perhaps in fierce and fatal
contests.
</p>

<p>
As Javan arrived at years of manhood, this unamiable
temper rather increased than lessened; and it was greatly
aggravated by the spirit of fanaticism which took
possession of his soul, and rendered his religion a motive to
fierce and arrogant conduct, instead of having the effect
of softening his heart, and leading him to such holy and
gentle and charitable dispositions as are most acceptable
to the God of love and mercy.  His father Zadok was of
the sect of the Pharisees, and was therefore a strict and
rigid observer of the ceremonial law,&mdash;not only of every
point which was enjoined by the lawgiver Moses, but
also of all those customs which were derived from the
traditions of the Elders.  He did not, however, fall into
the grievous error which was so severely rebuked by our
blessed Saviour; he did not, like so many of his
self-righteous brethren, "wash merely the outside of the cup
and platter, while inwardly their hearts were full of
extortion and violence;" neither did he "make broad his
phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of his garments,"
merely "to be seen of men."  It is true that such
erroneous motives did to a certain degree influence his
conduct, but he was nevertheless a man of sincere piety and
devotion; and his prayers in secret were not less frequent
and regular than the public acts of worship which,
according to the custom of the priests and Pharisees, be
performed in the streets and marketplaces.
</p>

<p>
Javan emulated, and even surpassed his excellent father
in a scrupulous adherence to the minutest points of
ceremony.  He performed the many ablutions prescribed by
law and tradition: and even paid tithe of the mint and
cummin, and other herbs, which grew almost spontaneously
in his father's fertile garden: but unhappily he
had none of the real piety which distinguished Zadok;
and the violence of his temper and haughtiness of his
disposition were a source of constant sorrow to his gentle
mother.
</p>

<p>
Salome was of a spirit far different to that of any of the
other members of her family: mild, timid, and dependent,
she was guided in everything by her husband; and as his
office in the priesthood necessarily kept him much from
home, she found herself unequal to controlling the spirits
of either Javan or Naomi; and her mistaken indulgence
was the cause of much that was to be regretted in the
character of each of her children.  The affectionate
disposition of Naomi, and the natural candour and rectitude
of her mind, preserved her from being as much injured as
her wayward brother was, by the undue liberty which
they enjoyed during their childhood and early youth.
She was devotedly attached to her mother; and from her
she derived those lessons of piety and fervent charity,
which were remarkable in her character, though the
energy of her soul carried her far beyond Salome in
enthusiastic feeling and active performance of duty.
She was the pride and delight of both her parents; and
probably the preference which they felt and could hardly
conceal for her, produced an evil tendency in the heart
of Javan; who, feeling that he was less beloved than his
sister, instead of endeavouring to imitate her dutiful and
affectionate behaviour, became sullen and morose, and
shunned the society of his family.  Naomi made every
effort to recover his affection, though with little success.
She wove for him the broadest and most beautiful fringes,
to adorn the borders of his festal garment according to
the commandment of the Lord to Moses, and fixed upon
the fringe a ribbon of the brightest blue.[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]  And she
employed the skill she had acquired from her father (and
which she possessed in a far higher degree than the
generality of Jewish females), in writing upon slips of
white parchment choice sentences from the law, to
compose the phylacteries that he wore on his forehead and
on his wrist&mdash;a custom which the Jews derived from the
direction to make the commandments of God "a sign
upon their hand, and a memorial between their eyes."[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>]
Unhappily it had become perverted from its original
meaning, and had sunk into a mere superstitious form;
and many, especially of the Pharisees, were contented to
carry the law of the Lord upon their persons and their
garments, while it entered not into their hearts.  When
Javan came home in a sullen mood, Naomi would take
her harp, and sing to him one of the songs of the royal
Psalmist; and her sweet voice had frequently the same
effect on her brother that the young shepherd's had on
Saul&mdash;the evil spirit would depart from him.  But it was
not the psalm of penitence or praise that he loved best to
hear; it was the tone of exultation and triumph, or the
prophecy of vengeance, that breathes forth in some of the
inspired songs of David, which met with corresponding
emotions in the breast of the fiery young Jew, and recalled
his spirit from its own passions and resentments, to a
contemplation of the promised restoration and glory of his
nation, and the signal punishment of all their foes.

<p>
It was a frequent practice of Zadok, and several other
of the most learned of his fraternity, to meet together for
the express purpose of studying those parts of the Scriptures
which so clearly set forth the future prosperity of
the Jews and the reign of the Messiah: and endeavouring
to calculate from the various dates which refer to that
blessed period, whether the appearance of their King and
Saviour might be speedily looked for, according to the
popular expectation.  At these meetings Javan always
attended; and his ardent and enthusiastic notions and wild
conjectures called forth the smiles, and sometimes the
reproofs, of the graver and more cool-headed rabbin, though
they highly commended his zeal, and the industry with
which he pursued the study of the Holy Scriptures.  He
was already a wonderful proficient in the sacred writings
which compose the Old Testament, and had transcribed
a large portion of them on the rolls of parchment
employed at that time as a substitute for books.  Zadok
was possessed also of several rare and precious manuscripts,
which contained the traditions of the Elders, and
were regarded by the scribes and Pharisees as of equal,
or even superior authority to the inspired Scriptures, and
in any disputed case were appealed to in preference to the
word of God himself.  These were also carefully studied
and highly reverenced by his bigoted son, who aspired
one day to become an authorised and distinguished
expounder of the oral or traditionary law, and to attain the
highly-desired title of <i>Rabbi</i> or teacher.
</p>

<p>
Into this family, the character of whose members we
have attempted to describe, Claudia, the heathen maiden,
was removed from the camp of the Roman army, and
domesticated as a daughter.  It may perhaps excite
surprise that her father, being himself an idolater, should
permit her thus to associate with Jews; but the fact was
that Rufus was an idolater because he had been brought
up as such, and not because he believed the worship of
Jupiter or Mars to be more rational than that of Jehovah.
His active military life had diverted his attention from
such subjects; and provided he acted uprightly in all the
relations of life, according to the dictates of his own
conscience and the laws of the empire, he did not hold it to
be a matter of much importance to what divinity he paid
the greatest adoration.  He did not wish his daughter to
become a Jew; nor did he think it probable that she
would be inclined to embrace a religion which appeared
to him so burdensome and ridiculous; and therefore he
did not oppose her urgent request to return to Jerusalem,
on the death of her mother, and seek protection in a
family whom he so highly respected and valued.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
</h3>

<p>
The day following that on which the conversation we
have related took place, was one of great rejoicing in
Jerusalem.  The noise of military preparation ceased,
and the tumults and conflicts which at that period so
Constantly disturbed the peace of the Holy City were for
a short time suspended.  It was the Feast of Pentecost,
the day on which the first-fruits were presented as a
burnt-offering to the Lord, and when the children of
Israel celebrated the completion of their plentiful
harvest, and "rejoiced before the Lord their God, with
their sons and their daughters and their servants, and
the Levites and the strangers that were within their
gates."  This was one of the three great national
festivals which were observed every year by the Jews,
according to the commandment of God, when all the
men were enjoined to assemble from the towns and
villages of Judea, and to appear before the Lord in his
temple.  The disturbed state of the country, and the
necessary absence of many of the Jews who had joined
the rebel forces of Galilee, or were engaged in
preparing for the expected attack of their own cities,
rendered the assemblage less numerous than in the time of
peace and security; and yet the streets were thronged.
The sound of musical instruments was heard in every
quarter, and many were the troops of young men and
maidens who were seen going up to the temple in the
measured and graceful steps of their solemn dances, while
they chanted hymns with their melodious voices, and
accompanied their songs with the harp and the psaltery.
</p>

<p>
Danger and dissension, and the discord of contending
factions appeared to be forgotten, and to the eye of a
stranger all was peace and joy.  The heart of Naomi
exulted while she joined in the dance with her young
companions, and among all the youthful throng her step
was the lightest and her voice the sweetest; at least they
appeared so, in the partial judgment of her mother and
her friend, who followed in the concourse that moved
towards the glorious and magnificent temple.  Claudia
took no part in the ceremony; but she could not look
unmoved on that countless multitude of worshippers,
assembled as with one heart to celebrate the praises of
their Deity, and to offer on his altar the first-fruits of the
bounteous harvest which had just been gathered in.
The exquisite beauty and richness of the building, which
was conspicuous from every part of the city and the
surrounding country, have been frequently described, and
must be familiar to every reader.  It rose high above
the whole city, and united the strength of a citadel with
the splendour of a sacred edifice.
</p>

<p>
We are told that the plain on which it was erected, and
which occupied the whole summit of the hill, had been
greatly enlarged since the time of Solomon, and now
consisted of a square of a furlong on each side.  The steep
sides of the rock were faced with stones of an enormous
size, some of them being seventy feet long; and we may
suppose that it was to these huge blocks so wonderfully
placed, and so accurately fitted together, that the
disciples called the attention of their Master, when, as they
stood over against the temple, they exclaimed in pride and
admiration, "Behold what manner of stones and what
buildings are here!"  The awful denunciation which he
then uttered&mdash;"There shall not be left here one stone
upon another that shall not be thrown down"&mdash;was now
rapidly approaching to its fulfilment, and the
hard-hearted and deluded inhabitants of that devoted city
knew it not, nor sought to avert the impending judgment
by humiliation and prayer.  Doubtless had they even
then returned, and sought the Lord, and humbled themselves,
like Nineveh in her day of threatened destruction,
they might, like Nineveh, have been heard and pardoned,
and saved.  But the pride and impenitence of the Jews
were unexampled, and awful was to be their punishment.
They would not be gathered under the wings of their
merciful and forgiving Saviour, and lo! their "city was
left unto them desolate."  The "eagles" were even now
"gathering together" to devour them, and they were
feasting and rejoicing, and insulting their Maker and
Governor, by offering to Him sacrifices while their hands
were stained with blood, and uttering praises to His name
while their hearts were full of cursing, and deceit, and lies.
Amidst the general corruption, there were yet, however,
a few faithful sons of Abraham remaining, though not
enough to save the city; and Zadok was of this number.
He stood by the altar, to receive from the hands of the
people the baskets which contained their offerings, and
to hear the declaration and confession which were
appointed to be uttered on this occasion;[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>] and no covetous
or unholy thoughts crossed his breast.  He was absorbed
in the feelings of gratitude, and hope, and adoration
which the ceremony was so well calculated to excite; and
his dignified form and noble countenance well became
the splendid robes in which as an officiating priest he
was attired.  Salome looked upon him with love and
veneration; and the proud heart of his daughter swelled
with a pardonable emotion, as with her young companions
she passed before him, and met the affectionate
eye of her father.  Naomi loved both her parents most
ardently; but she looked up to Zadok as to a being of
superior nature, whose will to her was law, and whose
slightest word could control all her wild thoughts and
wayward fancies.  "Ah," said she to her mother as she
returned to her side beneath the pillared cloisters, when
she had completed the circuit of the court in the solemn
procession, "if my father were but High Priest, or a
chief of one of the parties in Jerusalem, all would yet be
well.  His wisdom, and courage, and virtue would surely
reconcile all the disputes which now cause such tumult,
and threaten such danger to our beloved city; and should
the Romans dare to bring their legions against our walls,
with Zadok for our defender and the leader of our troops,
how soon would they be discomfited and driven away!
I almost wish to see their boasted armies approach, for
then would all the rival factions unite to oppose them,
and we should see my father go forth in the power and
protection of the Lord, with the holy band of priests, to
encounter the foe.  And then, O my mother! we should
behold Messiah coming in the glory of Heaven to finish
the conflict, and to restore to our city and beautiful
temple the majesty and power which once dwelt here.
I look round this gorgeous building, and I see marble
pillars and pinnacles of gold, and carved roofs, and
crowded ornaments of precious materials.  But where is
the presence of God, which once abode visibly among
his people, to sanctify them, and to separate them from
all others?  It has departed from us, and therefore, 'do
the heathen so furiously rage together' against us.  But
it will return&mdash;surely His presence will speedily return
to us, in the person of the Messiah, and we shall yet
see Jerusalem exalted, to be the glory of the whole
earth!"

<p>
"God grant it, Naomi," replied her less sanguine
mother; "but I confess I cannot utter my prayers in this
temple, without some awful forebodings that ere long the
worship may be interrupted, and even that fire and sword
may lay waste our beautiful, our rich, our joyous city.  I
fear that we may yet have to sink far lower than we are
now fallen, and endure to drink far deeper of the cup of
the Lord's vengeance before the sin of our race shall be
purged away, and the 'Desire of all nations shall appear
to re-establish the kingdom of his father David.'"
</p>

<p>
"O mother, why are you so fearful, and why do you
suffer such thoughts to fill your mind?  Can it ever be
that Jehovah will allow the Gentiles to triumph over his
chosen race, and trample on His courts and altars?"
</p>

<p>
"We know, Naomi, that the heathen nations of old
were permitted to conquer and desolate our city and our
temple; and now, when I see the state of impiety and
rebellion against the Lord into which my countrymen
are fallen, I cannot but look for a repetition of the same
awful judgments which have already been poured upon
this once favoured land.  Have you forgotten the terrible
sights and sounds that, two years ago, at the breaking out
of this fatal war occasioned so much consternation and
fear?  That dreadful sword of flame which hung, for
twelve long months, over the city; that fierce and sudden
light which, at the feast of unleavened bread, broke forth
about the altar and temple; and how the brazen gate on
the eastern side of this sacred building flew open of its
own accord, and was closed with so much difficulty by
the united force of the guard?  Many of our friends
looked on this as a token that God would open to us the
gate of blessing; but Zadok said not so.  He was present
at the fearful event, and he came home sad, and with
his countenance fallen; for he dreaded that it might be
a sign that the temple was no longer secure, and that ere
long the gate of the holy place might be thrown open to
the enemy."
</p>

<p>
"But," interrupted Naomi, "my father surely has no
such apprehensions now!  I hear him speaking
encouragement to all around him, and his spirit inspires
every one who hears him with hope and confidence."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my love, your father is animated by his own
courage and his trust in God.  The impression which
was made upon his mind by the events of which I am
speaking has subsided.  No calamities immediately
succeeded these warnings, and, like most of his brethren,
he now considers that the danger has passed away.  But
I have not the same conviction; I never can forget those
signs from heaven, or believe that they did not forebode
evils yet to come.  You stood with me upon our house-top
when, before sunset, that awful vision of chariots and
horsemen appeared in the heavens, and encompassed
the city in their wild and rapid course; and you heard
your father tell how at Pentecost, when he, with the
other priests then on duty, were entering the temple by
night, they heard strange rushing sounds, and a movement
within, and then a mighty voice, as of a multitude,
crying, 'Let us depart hence!'  O my child, from that
hour I have felt that the Lord has deserted us, and his
holy angels no longer keep watch over this sacred
building, to guard it from every foe.  And look! Naomi,
yonder, through the crowd, is passing that terrible and
mysterious man who has haunted our city, like an evil
spirit, ever since the war began, and indeed while we
were yet in peace and prosperity.  No threats, no
punishments have been able to silence him; and now, when
we are met together to hold a feast to the Lord, and
celebrate his goodness, the son, of Ananus comes to blight our
joy, and shed a gloom over every countenance."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, this strange and terrific being passed
through the midst of the assembled throng, who shrunk
from him as from one whose presence brought a curse.
He entered the vacant space which surrounded the spot
where the priests were officiating, and raising his bare
and haggard arms on high, he exclaimed in a voice so
loud and piercing as to be heard by all who filled those
spacious courts, "A voice from the east!&mdash;a voice from
the west!&mdash;a voice from the four winds!&mdash;a voice against
Jerusalem, and against the temple!&mdash;a voice against the
bridegrooms and the brides!&mdash;a voice against the whole
people!"&mdash;and then he moved across the court, and
disappeared among the crowd on the opposite side.  A
shudder ran through the whole assembly; every voice
was hushed, and every eye was turned to follow this
prophet of evil.  None raise a hand to arrest his course,
for all now feared him, and knew that, though when he
first appeared in Jerusalem, and uttered his warning cry,
he had been scourged until the bones were seen through
the flesh, yet that he had never either shrieked or groaned
for pain, but still had raised his sad and faltering voice,
and cried at every blow, "Woe, woe to Jerusalem!"  He
was looked upon as a maniac, and now wandered
undisturbed through the city, night and day as he
traversed the narrow streets still crying, "Woe to
Jerusalem!"  And at the return of every festival, when crowds
were gathered together, and mirth and joy were abroad,
his gaunt and melancholy form was sure to be seen
gliding slowly through the multitude, and his ominous
voice was heard still uttering no other words.
</p>

<p>
Before the dense crowd which now filled the temple
had recovered from the effect which his appearance never
failed to excite, he had descended the hill, and was
traversing the almost deserted streets; and in the silence
which succeeded his departure, his voice could still be
heard dying away in the distance in the same melancholy
tone.  The multitude shortly afterwards dispersed, and
the gaiety of the city ceased; for ere the services of the
temple were concluded, the chief priests and leaders of
the people were hastily summoned to meet in council, and
consider a despatch which had just arrived from the
commander of the Jewish forces in Galilee.  But in order
more fully to understand the importance of this despatch,
it will be necessary to give a brief sketch of the state of
affairs at this time in Judea, and of the events that had
occurred since the breaking out of the rebellion, which
ended in the total desolation of this unhappy country.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of insurrection had been abroad for several
years, and many attempts had been made to throw off the
yoke of the Roman power.  The success, however, had
been very partial, and could ill repay the expenditure of
blood and life which had been incurred in the misguided
efforts of the Jews to regain their liberty and independence.
They had no foreign allies to assist and strengthen
them, for all the other Roman dominions were in peace;
and even their own countrymen who were settled in
distant provinces took but little interest in the struggles
of their native land, or were too much occupied in
endeavouring to secure their own safety, to have either
leisure or power to aid in the revolt of Judea.  Even
their nominal king Agrippa, had openly declared for the
Roman power; and the Jews had no acknowledged or
distinguished leader to guide them, and direct their fierce
and obstinate, but undisciplined troops.  The attempt
was therefore wild, and all but hopeless; and yet we
cannot read the account of the cruelties and oppressions
which were heaped upon this once blessed race by many
of the Roman governors, and wonder that they should
spend their life-blood in the effort to shake off the galling
and ignominious yoke.  The tyranny which was practised
upon them by Cuspius Fadus, by Felix, by Festus, and
more especially by Florus, had galled their proud spirit
beyond endurance; and in the year of our Lord 66, they
were in open rebellion against their conquerors.
</p>

<p>
The bold defiance of this comparatively weak and
insignificant province excited the astonishment and even
the alarm of the Emperor Nero, and he immediately
dispatched Vespasian, one of his greatest generals, to take
the command of Syria, and to use the promptest measures
for quelling the revolt, before the example of these daring
men should be followed by the surrounding provinces.
Vespasian sent his son Titus to Alexandria, to bring
from thence the fifth and tenth legions; and set out
himself without delay for Syria, collecting by the way all
the Roman troops, and the tributary forces from the
neighbouring kingdoms.
</p>

<p>
These active measures on the part of the Roman
emperor struck terror into many of the rebels, who
hastened to offer their submission; but the greater part
were determined to resist to the uttermost.  A general
meeting of the chief men in Jerusalem was summoned
in the temple, for the purpose of choosing governors and
commanders; and Joseph the son of Gorion, and Ananus
the high-priest, were elected as governors in the city;
while Joseph the son of Mathias (more commonly known
as Josephus the historian) was appointed to the
command of Galilee; and other chiefs were entrusted with
the defence of the remaining districts and cities.  Eleazar,
the son of Simon, who had been active in the first
movements of the insurrection, had no authority committed to
him; but being the commander of the temple guard, he
contrived to gain possession of a large portion of the
public treasures, and the spoils which had been taken
from the Romans at the breaking out of the war.  He
therefore, by means of this wealth, obtained great power
and influence over the people; which, as we shall
hereafter perceive, he exerted to no good purpose.
</p>

<p>
Josephus immediately hastened to his government in
Galilee, where it was expected that the struggle would
first take place.  This country was rich and fertile, and
inhabited by a numerous and hardy population of Jews
and Syrians intermixed.  It was divided into two
districts, Upper and Lower Galilee, and Sepphoris was
the capital city.  The fortification of this important
place Josephus entrusted to the celebrated John of
Gischala, a crafty and deceitful man, but bold,
enterprising, and active; and who afterwards opposed all the
measures of the governor, and promoted the spirit of
discord which already divided the province, and thus
proved an obstacle to the effectual resistance of the
common foe.  Jotapata, Tiberias, and some deep caves near
the lake of Gennesareth were also strongly fortified,
besides many other towns and fortresses; and an army
of 60,000 foot soldiers was established, besides a
considerable body of cavalry.  But all the wise and prudent
schemes of Josephus were constantly rendered ineffectual
by the plots and opposition of John of Gischala, whom
he himself had raised to power.  He had formerly been
a poor and desperate adventurer, and lived by robbery
and violence: he by degrees induced others as
unprincipled as himself to join him, and formed a numerous
banditti, who ravaged the country, committing every
kind of outrage; and to this dangerous man was entrusted,
in the present emergency, the command of the Galilean
capital.
</p>

<p>
For many months the contest and rivalry between
John and Josephus continued, and greatly interrupted
the defence of the country; and time and money were
wasted in mutual endeavours to gain over the chiefs of
Jerusalem to espouse the cause of each party.  In the
metropolis, the preparations for war and defence were
carried on with zeal and energy, and the streets and
public places echoed with the clash of arms and the tramp
of the soldiers marching to exercise.  The prudent and
the timid trembled at the prospect of the miseries and
desolation to which they foresaw their glorious city and
luxuriant fields might be ere long devoted; but the fear
in which the peaceable inhabitants were held by the
zealots the fanatics, and the assassins, who ruled in the
city, silenced every murmur, and checked every sigh for
the re-establishment of the dominion of the Romans.
</p>

<p>
By the command of Ananus, the high-priest, the walls
were repaired and strengthened, arms and military
engines were manufactured, and provisions and other
necessary articles were collected, and stored up in
abundance, to be ready in case of a siege.  It was not
only from the timid and disaffected in the city that Ananus
experienced coldness, and had to contend; his power was
opposed without the walls by Simon, the son of Gioras,
who, at the head of a lawless band of ruffians, overran
and pillaged the toparchy of Acrabatene, breaking open
the dwellings of the rich, and ill-treating all who
endeavoured to put a stop to his deeds of violence and cruelty.
The high-priest sent forth a body of troops against him;
but the fierce Simon escaped their vengeance, and found
safety in the town of Masada, from whence he made
incursions into Idumæa.
</p>

<p>
Thus were the affairs of Judea and Galilee situated
when the spring of the year 67 commenced; and
Vespasian with his mighty forces appeared at Antioch, and
was joined by King Agrippa and his army.  On his
march toward Ptolemais he was met by an embassy
from Sepphoris, with overtures of submission, which, in
spite of the opposition of the governor of Galilee, the
inhabitants of the capital persisted in making to the
invaders; and Vespasian sent them back with a strong
reinforcement of troops, under the command of Placidus,
to protect the town from the vengeance of the rebel Jews.
Josephus made an ineffectual effort to regain possession
of the capital; but the attempt only provoked the Romans
to greater cruelty, and thousands of the inhabitants of
the adjacent country were destroyed by fire and sword,
or carried away as captives.  At Ptolemais, Titus joined
his father with the troops from Alexandria, and the whole
army of Vespasian now amounted to 60,000, including
cavalry, besides the mixed multitude that followed the
camp, many of whom were employed when occasion
required.
</p>

<p>
Josephus saw that it was vain to oppose so formidable
an army in the open field, and he sent forth orders for
all the inhabitants of the villages to take refuge in the
fortified cities.  Many were cut off, and slaughtered in
the flight; but the greatest part of the population were
able to secure their retreat, and found present safety
within the walls and bulwarks.  The Jewish commander
took up his own station at Jotapata, the strongest and
most important of all the cities of Galilee; and thither
the troops under Placidus were led, in the hope that by
a sudden attack the place might be captured, and the
governor himself taken prisoner.  But Josephus was
aware of this intention, and sallied forth to meet the
Romans with such impetuosity that they were repulsed,
and forced to retreat; and this success inspired the Jews
with fresh courage and determination.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto the main body of the vast army of Vespasian
had been inactive; but he was now resolved to lead them
forth himself, and crush the rebellious Jews with his
resistless force.  The foremost troops consisted of the
archers and the light-armed allies, who preceded the
cavalry and heavy-armed infantry, examining every
thicket and wood, to discover whether the enemy were
lurking in ambush.  After the cavalry came the pioneers,
with their spades and pickaxes, to clear away all obstacles
which might interrupt the march of the phalanx; the
camp-furniture followed, under a strong guard; then the
general and his troop of horse, succeeded by the military
engines and their attendant engineers.  The lieutenant-generals
and their inferior officers came next in order
and after them the standards, the glittering eagles, which
were looked upon as sacred.  To every legion one of
these was appropriated, and the attachment of the Roman
soldiers to these emblems of their national power was
almost invincible.  It was inspired both by their religion,
feelings and their sentiments of honour; and it was looked
upon as no less impious than it was disgraceful to forsake
the standard in the hour of danger.  Next advanced the
formidable phalanx, followed by the servants with the
private baggage and the mercenary troops; and the
procession was closed by a strong guard of both horse and
foot.  The news of the movement of this host struck
terror into the army of Josephus, which was encamped at
Garis; and without waiting to encounter the dreaded foe,
they dispersed, leaving their general almost in despair:
and he was compelled to seek refuge, with the small
remnant who adhered to him, in Tiberias.
</p>

<p>
Gadara was the first city which fell beneath the arms
of Vespasian; and he made it a signal example of his
vengeance, burning it down to the ground, and destroying
all its inhabitants.  Consternation was spread abroad, and
the retreat of Josephus into Tiberias was looked upon as
a proof that even he no longer entertained any hopes of
success.  But he resolved still to continue his resistance,
and sent emissaries to Jerusalem with a strong
representation of the necessity of their immediately
dispatching a powerful army into Galilee, or of abandoning the
cause at once, and submitting to the invaders.  It was
this important message which reached the metropolis
during the celebration of the Feast of Pentecost, and
occasioned the sudden dispersion of the assembly.  The
nature of the communication was speedily noised abroad,
and filled the hearts of the timid and peaceable
inhabitants with apprehension and anxiety; and even the
bravest warriors were somewhat discouraged when they
heard how closely Josephus was pressed, and the
unfavourable aspect of the affairs in Galilee.
</p>

<p>
The chief priests and leading men of the city
immediately assembled to consult on the best mode of affording
assistance to their commander;[<a id="chap02fn2text"></a><a href="#chap02fn2">2</a>] but the factions and
dissensions of the different parties were already so violent,
that, after a long and angry discussion, the council broke
up without coming to any final determination; and it
appeared to be tacitly agreed, that those who chose to
volunteer on the service might go to the aid of their
countrymen in Galilee; but no authorised leader was
appointed to conduct them.  The spirit of Javan was
roused with indignation when he heard that no relief was
to be sent to Josephus, and he eagerly declared his
intention of setting out for the seat of the war.  His example
and his fiery exhortations induced many of his young
companions to embrace the same resolution; and as soon as
the necessary preparations could be made, they departed
from the city, accompanied by the messengers who had
brought the Jewish commander's despatches.  They
reached Tiberias in safety, and joined Josephus in time
to accompany him to Jotapata, into which city he
contrived, with much difficulty, to throw himself and his
followers, when he found that the steps of Vespasian were
directed towards that place.  A deserter informed the
Roman general of this event, which added to his eagerness
for the capture of the town, as he hoped at the same
time to gain possession of his most active enemy; and
he instantly dispatched Æbutius and Placidus with a
thousand horse, to surround the walls and prevent the
possibility of his escape.  The following day, being the
15th of May, A.D. 67, Vespasian advanced with his whole
army; but the particulars of the long and interesting
siege of this important post must be deferred for a time,
while we return to Naomi and her friends in Jerusalem.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
</h3>

<p>
The seditions within the city, and the threatened dangers
without, had not yet interrupted the regular course of
life of the inhabitants, who continued to cultivate their
gardens and vineyards, though at times their hearts
misgave them that they might not be permitted to gather in
the fruits.  The garden of Zadok, by the brook Kedron,
was one of the most luxuriant in all that fertile vale; and
the date and pomegranate-trees, the spreading fig-trees,
and graceful vines, afforded a delightful shade from the
beams of the summer sun, and provided the family of the
priest with a plentiful supply of delicious fruits.  This
garden was the frequent and favourite retreat of Salome
and her daughter, who, with Claudia and some of the
female domestics, spent much of their time in training
and cultivating the vines that clothed the walls, and
securing the boughs that ran along the summit by stones
tied to the ends, to prevent the weight of the heavy
clusters from bringing them to the ground.  The melons
and cucumbers, which also grew in abundance on the
margin of the stream, required much of their care and
attention; and when these occupations were finished,
they were accustomed to seat themselves in a shady spot,
and pursue some of the domestic manufactures which
were usually carried on in every Jewish family.  In one
corner of the extensive garden was placed the handmill,
which was daily worked by the female servants to procure
the necessary supply of flour for the consumption of
the house; and though the work was very laborious and
fatiguing, the voices of those engaged in it were always
heard singing gaily and harmoniously, to lighten their
toil.  The cheerful sound was accompanied by the
monotonous noise of the grindstone, so often alluded to
in Scripture, and by the rippling of the water where the
brooks of Siloam and Kedron united their streams.  All
in this favoured spot spoke of peace and happy security;
and therefore Salome loved to leave the noisy and
tumultuous city, and spend the hours when Zadok was
engaged in his public duties in this calm retreat.  Here,
surrounded by her maidens, she and Naomi directed
them in their occupations of spinning and weaving linen,
which they sometimes manufactured of a beautiful fineness,
notwithstanding the simple construction of their
looms and other implements.
</p>

<p>
In all her domestic labours, Salome was greatly assisted
by the faithful Deborah, who was the chief of the female
domestics, and had lived all her life in the family of
Zadok.  She was now in the decline of life, but still
active and cheerful, and entirely devoted to the interest
of her master.  She had nursed and brought up both
Javan and Naomi, and loved them with the most intense
affection.  It must be owned that her indulgence had in
no small degree tended to foster the pride and self-will
that were so conspicuous in the character of Javan, and,
in a less disagreeable form, in that of his sister also; but
her intentions were always good, and she would willingly
have laid down her own life at any time, if she could by
the sacrifice promote the welfare of her beloved charges.
They were both sincerely and gratefully attached to her;
and Javan never appeared to so great advantage as when,
after a temporary absence, he returned to his home, and
bent to receive the embraces and blessings of his
venerable nurse.  But Naomi was her chief comfort and the
delight of her life.  Her beauty, her grace, her melodious
voice, her amiable and animated disposition, and her zeal
for the glory of God and the honour of her nation, were
the constant theme of the good old woman's praises,
which were frequently lavished, rather injudiciously, in
the hearing of Naomi herself; till at length the
high-spirited girl almost believed that she was of a superior
nature to the rest of her companions, and formed to take
the lead among her countrywomen.  Salome saw and
deplored this great fault in her character, and strove
ineffectually to correct it.  Her daughter was invariably
respectful and affectionate to her and to her father, but
the natural pride of her heart was unsubdued.  It was to
be humbled by means of which Salome never dreamed,
and by a power far greater than her maternal exhortations
and reproofs.
</p>

<p>
It chanced one day that Salome had occasion to send
Deborah on an errand to the village of Bethany, about
two miles distant from Jerusalem; and Claudia being
otherwise occupied, Naomi alone accompanied her nurse
on the expedition.  They left the city by the water-gate,
and having crossed the brook Kedron, and passed
along the gardens and olive-yards that flourished along
its banks, they began slowly to ascend the Mount of
Olives.  Part of the ascent was steep and fatiguing; and
as Deborah leaned on the arm of her active young
companion, she recalled to her remembrance the sad time
when their pious and glorious King David had also
crossed that brook, and mounted by that same ascent,
with his head covered and his feet bare, and weeping as
he went, a fugitive from his own city, and driven into
the wilderness by the cruelty and ambition of his darling
son.  It must have been a moving sight to behold that
once mighty king, now bending beneath the weight of
years and bitter sorrows, and shedding tears as he toiled
barefoot up the mountain, "while all the people that
went with him covered every man his head, weeping as
they went up."  But tears of greater worth had been
shed on that spot, when the "Man of Sorrows" stood
on that mount, and beheld the city of Jerusalem, and
wept over it, saying, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, if thou
hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the
things that belong unto thy peace!&mdash;but now they are
hid from thine eyes.  For the days shall come upon thee
that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and
compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side;
and they shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy
children within thee, and they shall not leave in thee
one stone upon another, because thou knowest not the
time of thy visitation."  This affecting prophecy was
unknown by Naomi, and would have been listened to
with contempt, as uttered by the despised and crucified
Jesus of Nazareth, whose name she had never heard
repeated but as that of an impostor and malefactor, the
leader of the hated sect of the Nazarenes.  She lived,
however, to see that very prophecy fulfilled&mdash;awfully
and literally fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
Naomi and Deborah had nearly reached the highest
part of the road, from whence a most commanding view
was to be obtained of the Holy City, when they observed
an aged woman sitting by the roadside, and while her
eyes were fixed on the city below, the tears were flowing
down her venerable cheeks.  There was something in
her countenance that attracted the attention of Naomi;
and the age and apparent infirmities of this solitary
mourner excited in her benevolent heart a strong desire
to know the cause of her distress, and if possible to
alleviate it.  The woman was plainly, but respectably
dressed, and had no appearance of poverty or bodily
suffering, but it seemed that some melancholy reflections in
her own mind had drawn forth her tears.  On remarking
that the eyes of the young Jewess were fixed upon her
with intense curiosity, she hastily attempted to rise, as if
to avoid further observation; but the staff on which she
leaned for support slipped from her trembling hand, and
she would have fallen to the ground, if Naomi had not
sprung forward and caught her.  She thanked her kindly
and gratefully, and then resuming her staff, she would
have proceeded alone; but as it appeared that she also
was bending her steps towards Bethany, Naomi insisted
on her leaning on her arm, and promised to take care of
her as far as the village, where she and her nurse were
going.
</p>

<p>
Deborah did not quite approve of this proposition, as
she saw that the old woman moved very slowly, and she
found that if they tarried for her it would be very late
before they returned to the city; she therefore reminded
her young charge that the day was wearing away, and
that her mother would be alarmed if she did not return
before sunset.  But Naomi was not to be turned from
her purpose, whether for good or for evil; and on this
occasion she was determined not to abandon the aged
stranger, for whom she felt a peculiar and increasing
interest.  She informed Deborah of her intention,
begging her to proceed to Bethany, and execute the
commission of her mother, while she would remain with her
new friend&mdash;for such she already felt her to be&mdash;and
join her nurse on her return.
</p>

<p>
Deborah had never opposed her, and she saw no necessity
for doing so on the present occasion; though, could
she have foreseen the ultimate consequences of that
meeting, she would doubtless have considered it her
duty to exert an unwonted degree of authority, and
check the dangerous friendship that Naomi was about to
form.  But she anticipated no evil from Naomi's
exercising towards this infirm old woman the benevolence
and kindness that she always showed for those in suffering
or distress; and she therefore hastened forward with
an activity that was surprising at her time of life, and
left Naomi to exert her endeavours to discover the cause
of the tears which had so greatly excited her sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"Will you tell me," she timidly began, for she almost
feared to intrude on the feelings of the venerable
stranger,&mdash;"will you tell me wherefore you are in grief,
good mother?  It pains me to see you weep, and I
should be so happy if it was in my power to wipe away
those tears."
</p>

<p>
"Bless thee, my child," replied the old woman, with
emotion, "these are the kindest words that I have heard
addressed to me for many years.  I am a solitary being
now.  All those who loved me best are long ago laid in
the grave, and the friends whom I have found in later
years have almost all retired to distant and more secure
countries.  But it was not for this that I wept; my tears
were not those of sorrow for my own condition, which I
would not change with the happiest and wealthiest in
that city; but I wept for those who now dwell there in
fancied security, and heed not the ruin that is coming
upon them."
</p>

<p>
"What ruin?" said Naomi; "are you one of those
who dread the Roman power, and think that we shall be
given into their hands?  My mother sometimes gives
way to such fears, but it vexes my soul to hear her; for
till I see the Gentiles trampling on our holy places I will
never believe that they will again be permitted to enter
the sacred walls of Jerusalem as conquerors.  I should
rejoice to hear of the near approach of the Gentile army;
for, when all nations are gathered against Jerusalem to
battle, then shall the Lord go forth against those nations,
as when he fought in the day of battle.[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]  His feet shall
stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, as our prophet
Zechariah has testified; and oh! that I may live to
see that glorious day, when Messiah shall at length come
upon the earth!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Messiah is already come," said the stranger, gently
and solemnly.
</p>

<p>
Naomi started, and turned to gaze on the countenance
of the speaker.  "What!" she exclaimed, in accents of
horror, "are you a Nazarene?  Are you a believer in
that Galilean impostor, who suffered the just recompense
of his seditions and deceptions?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a humble follower of the Holy Jesus, the Son of
the Most High God, <i>who suffered for our transgressions,
and rose again for our justification</i>," replied the stranger.
</p>

<p>
Naomi shrunk back, and dropped the arm of the aged
Christian, as if she felt the touch of one who professed
that detested creed to be pollution, and words of scorn
and contempt rose to her lips.  But her better feelings
repressed these expressions; and a sentiment which she
could not comprehend drew her again to the gentle and
venerable woman, whom in her prejudiced judgment she
despised.  Again she offered her support to the stranger,
and again it was accepted with grateful courtesy, while
a benevolent smile lighted up her naturally serious
countenance, as she observed the struggle in her young
companion's feelings.
</p>

<p>
"You have been brought up, my daughter, to look
upon us as a deluded and despicable sect, who have justly
incurred the scorn and punishment that have so heavily
been laid upon us, because we have forsaken the religion
of our forefathers, and declared our belief that He, whom
our chief priests and elders considered worthy of a cruel
death, was indeed the Lord Christ, the long-promised
Messiah.  But there is a frankness in your manner and
countenance that convinces me you only continue in this
error because you are ignorant of the grounds of our
faith, and have been taught to give credit to the false
statements invented to excuse the murder of the Lord of
Life, and to conceal the wondrous fact of his resurrection
from the dead."
</p>

<p>
"I know," replied Naomi, "that it is said his disciples
carried away his body by night, and then declared that
he was risen.  But who over saw him alive after his
crucifixion?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>I did</i>," answered the stranger.  "My eyes beheld
him surrounded by his disciples; my hands touched his
sacred and human form; my ears listened to his gracious
voice, speaking as never man spake; and my heart
believed and was comforted.  I was with his sorrowing
disciples when, on the day of his resurrection, we
assembled to mourn over his death, and our blighted hopes;
and in fear and trembling, because of the indignation of
the Jews against his followers, we had closed the doors
on our sad meeting.  And then, while consternation
filled every breast, He whom we wept as dead suddenly
appeared in the midst of us, and said in his well-known
voice, 'Peace be unto you.'  Only those who were then
present can know the feelings of our hearts at this
unexpected apparition.  We could not believe that it was he
himself in bodily form, for our hearts were hardened,
and we remembered not the words which he had spoken
unto us, that he must be killed, and rise again the third
day; and we thought that it was his spirit.  But he
showed us his hands and his side, so lately pierced by the
nails and the spear of his murderers; and then we were
glad, for we knew it was the Lord himself.  And at
other times I saw him, when he took bread, and did eat
it before us, that no doubts might remain in our minds
as to the actual resurrection of his body.  And last of all
I saw him, when he led his disciples out as far as to
Bethany, and having exhorted them, and comforted them
with the promise of his continual presence, he lifted up
his hands and blessed them; and then, while every eye
was fixed upon him, he rose slowly into the air, and
ascended until a cloud received him out of our sight.
Oh! how fervently did we then worship our risen and exalted
Saviour!  And while we yet looked steadfastly toward
heaven, as he went up, two heavenly messengers stood
by us in shining garments, and said, 'Why stand ye
gazing up into heaven?  This same Jesus, which is taken
up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner
as you have seen him go into heaven.'  Then we knew
that he would no more visit the earth in person, until the
latter day; and we returned to Jerusalem, full of joy and
thanksgiving."
</p>

<p>
"Your words are wonderful to me," said Naomi.  "I
cannot think that you are trying to deceive me; and yet
I cannot believe that all these strange things did really
take place.  I ought not, perhaps, to listen to you; and
doubtless, my father, who is a priest of the holy temple,
would be greatly displeased if he knew that I was holding
converse with a Nazarene; and yet I feel an unaccountable
interest in what you have been relating, and a strong
desire to hear more of the Christian's faith and the
Christian's God.  Did you often see this Jesus of Nazareth
before he was put to death, and did you then believe in
him?  I know that his disciples declared that he performed
many and wonderful miracles; but our elders say that
he worked them by the powers of Beelzebub, like the
sorcerers of old.  Did you ever witness any of these
miracles?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my child, I was so highly favoured as to be
present when he performed one of his most merciful and
glorious miracles; for I am Mary, the sister of that
Lazarus of Bethany whom he raised from the dead, and
I beheld my brother come forth from the grave, where
he had lain for several days, at the Almighty voice of
the Son of God!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, tell me that wonderful story," cried Naomi.  "I
have heard that Jesus did once raise a dead man to life,
but I did not believe it; or I thought that if it was really
true, yet that it was done by the assistance of evil spirits,
or at all events that it was only performed at the
command, and by the power of Almighty God, bestowed on
him for that particular purpose, as it once was on our
great prophet Elijah."
</p>

<p>
"It is true that the Lord Jesus did restore several
persons to life, besides healing the sick, cleansing the
lepers, giving sight to the blind, and speech to the dumb,
and casting devils out of those who were possessed.  But in
all these miraculous works he differed from the prophets
and holy men who have in former days been permitted to
perform some similar wonders; for they only acted by the
command of God, and had no power of themselves to
restore the life, and health, and faculties which God alone
can give or take away.  But Jesus Christ possessed this
power in himself, as the eternal Son of the Most High
God; and he employed it according to his own most
gracious will, saying to the leper, 'Be thou healed;' to the
deaf and dumb, 'Be opened;' to the devils, 'I command
thee to come out;' to the lame and the palsied,
'Take up thy bed and walk;' and to the dead, 'I say
unto thee, arise'&mdash;'Lazarus, come forth!'  The wind ceased
at his command, and the waves were calm at the sound
of his voice; and what was more wondrous still, the hearts
of many sinners were changed; and those who had been
vile and reprobate became sincere and godly men, living
lives of devotion to the honour of God their Saviour, and
the good of their fellow-creatures; and at last sealing
their faith with their blood, and dying for the sake of Him
who had died for them."
</p>

<p>
The earnestness with which the aged Mary spoke had
almost overpowered her, and she stood still and trembled.
Naomi, who was profoundly interested in her discourse,
and most desirous that she should continue her recital,
proposed to her that they should sit down on a grassy
bank by the roadside, and there wait the return of Deborah
from the village, which was not now far distant; and
Mary could proceed thither at leisure, after resting herself
from the fatigue of the ascent, and the excitement of
speaking on a subject in which her heart was so deeply
engaged.  She told Naomi that she should wish to proceed
a little further on the road before they seated themselves,
for that the sacred and interesting spot where her
brother had lain in his temporary grave was but a few
paces distant; and there, where she herself frequently
resorted to meditate on the astonishing event of his
resurrection, she would detail to her young friend all the
particulars that had marked the transaction.

</p>

<p>
They accordingly advanced beneath some precipitous
rocks that overhung the road on one side, and which
were broken by several chasms, extending a considerable
depth into the surface.  At one of these caves, larger and
deeper than the rest, Mary paused, and invited Naomi to
descend a few rough steps, that led to a small and rocky
area in front of the cavern where the body of Lazarus was
laid.  Here, in full view of the dark sepulchre, they sat
down on a fallen mass of stone, while Mary related to her
attentive auditor the scenes that were indelibly impressed
on her own memory.
</p>

<p>
"You will not wonder, my dear young friend," she
said, "at the warmth with which I speak of the blessed
Jesus, when I tell you of all his mercy and love towards
me and my brother and sister.  He often retired to
Bethany from the noise and crowd of the city, and our
house was honoured by being made his home.  The light
of his countenance shed joy and peace over our dwelling,
and his words were as heavenly music, to which we could
have listened for ever.  Oh! it was a blessed privilege
to sit at his feet, and hear his words, and receive the
divine instruction that flowed from his gracious lips.  It
was in the month Tisri,[<a id="chap03fn2text"></a><a href="#chap03fn2">2</a>] a few days after our beloved
Master had spent a day in our humble dwelling on his
return into the country from attending the feast of
tabernacles, that our brother Lazarus fell sick, and we
soon perceived that his sickness was mortal.  My sister
and I were in deep distress; but we remembered the
power and love of Jesus, and we delayed not to send a
messenger to Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where we
knew that he abode at that time.  We could not doubt
his willingness to succour us in our affliction, for he
loved Lazarus, and he loved us also.  Therefore we only
sent to him, saying, 'Lord, behold he whom thou lovest
is sick;' and we were fully convinced that he would
instantly return to us and heal our brother.  But our
messenger had not long been gone when a fearful change
took place in Lazarus.  The fever increased, the struggles
of death came on, and in anguish and despair we saw
our only, our beloved brother expire!  Did not Jesus
know what was passing beneath our humble roof at
Bethany?  And could not he, who had performed so
many miracles, have stayed the hand of death, and
restored Lazarus to health with one word of his mouth?
Such were the thoughts of our faithless hearts while
weeping over the bed of death, and preparing for the
hasty burial which is customary and necessary in this
climate.

<p>
"The place where Jesus then abode was a day's journey
from Bethany; and Lazarus was laid in his cold grave
almost at the moment when our messenger reached him
who we hoped would come and heal him.  The following
day we expected to see our Lord arrive, if not to
restore our brother, yet to comfort our bleeding hearts
with his words of grace and love.  But the messenger
returned alone; and the reply which he brought us only
weakened our expiring faith.  Jesus had said to him,
'This sickness is not unto death,' and yet Lazarus was
in the grave&mdash;what could we believe? what could we
hope?
</p>

<p>
"Two more days, long melancholy days, passed away,
and we sat mourning in our house, once the abode of
happiness, and peace, and brotherly love&mdash;now gloomy
and silent, save when the cry of the mourners, who sat
with us on the ground, burst forth in a wild and sudden
wail, and caused our tears to flow afresh.  Many of our
friends had come from the city to comfort us; but their
sympathy brought us no relief, for our brother was
dead, and Jesus had forsaken us; and all the consolation
that Christians may now feel in the knowledge that
Christ has purchased for them life and immortality, was
but dimly understood by us.  We had an uncertain
hope that hereafter we should meet our brother in a
happier world, and that Jesus would, with his own blood,
wipe away all our sins and all our sorrows for ever.
While we sat bowed down with grief, we heard a sound
as of a distant multitude.  The noise approached, and
we soon perceived that Jesus and his disciples were
drawing near the town.  How anxiously had we watched
and waited for that sound during the sad days that
preceded our brother's death!  But now it came too late&mdash;our
faithless hearts dared not to indulge a hope that
Lazarus should live again.  Nevertheless Martha rose
hastily, and went forth to meet our Lord, but I did not
go with her; I sat still in the house, oppressed with
sorrow.  Soon she returned to me, and whispered softly,
'The Master is come, and calleth for thee,' and quickly
I rose and went unto him; for he was still in the place
where Martha met him, outside the town.  When I
saw his kind and gracious countenance, and thought on
all his power and all his love, my grief and disappointed
hopes overpowered my feelings of veneration and respect;
and falling down at his feet, I exclaimed in the bitterness
of my spirit, 'Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died!'  It was a sinful murmur, but
the merciful Jesus saw only the sorrow that dictated it,
and did not reprove me; nay more, he sympathised in
our human sufferings, and when he saw me weeping,
and the Jews also weeping which came with me, he
groaned aloud, and his countenance was troubled, and
he said, 'Where have ye laid him?'  We said to him,
'Lord, come and see;' and we led him towards this
spot.  Jesus wept!  Yes, my child, he who had power
over earth and heaven, the eternal Son of God, shed
tears of sorrow for the death of his friend.  He knew
that that death would soon be chased away; he knew that
at his word the dead would rise and all our grief would
be swallowed up in joy, but yet he wept at the sight of
human misery and woe.  At length we reached the
sepulchre; a large stone was placed before that cave
which contained the body of Lazarus, and Jesus
commanded us to remove it.  Still did we not believe his
gracious intentions; and my sister remonstrated against
the stone being taken away, as she feared that ere that
time putrefaction had begun, and that the remains of
our dear brother were a prey to the worms.  But Jesus
gently reminded her of what he had said to her when
first she went forth to meet him, saying, 'Said I not
unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest
see the glory of God?'  Then did hope once more
animate our breasts, and in breathless anxiety we watched
to see the end.  When the heavy stone was taken away,
there lay the lifeless corpse wrapped in grave-cloths.
Jesus lifted up his eyes, and praised his heavenly Father;
and then in a loud voice he cried, 'Lazarus, come
forth!'  What a thrill passed through the heart of every one of
those who stood by, when from that dark cave we saw
the dead arise and come forth endued with life!  At the
command of Jesus we hastily took away the cloths in
which his hands and feet and face were bound, and
beheld once more the beloved countenance of our brother,
beaming with the same tender affection that was ever
wont to animate it.  I will not attempt to describe to
you the joy and gratitude that filled our hearts, or the
wonder that struck upon all who had witnessed this
miracle.  Many henceforth believed in Jesus, and this
day was to them the beginning of life and eternal
salvation: but some there were who could not be
convinced, even by what they had seen, that Jesus was the
Christ; and they went and told his deadly enemies the
Pharisees, who were jealous of every wonderful work
that he performed, and feared that the people should
believe on him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Naomi, "is it possible that any could
behold such proofs of his power and his goodness, and
yet seek to betray him into the hands of those who hated
him!  I am filled with wonder and amazement at all
you have told me; and I am almost tempted to believe
that ha was indeed Messiah.  But then wherefore was
he poor, and despised, and forsaken, and crucified?
Wherefore did he not crush all his enemies, and take
unto himself his great power, and reign over Judah?"
</p>

<p>
"I could reply to all those objections, my daughter,"
replied Mary, "but time will not now permit me.  I see
your companion coming towards us from the village, and
my own strength is exhausted.  I cannot recall the
feelings of that blessed period of my life without deep
emotion; but should we ever meet again, how gladly would
I renew the subject, and endeavour to deepen the
impression that I see is already made on your young heart."
</p>

<p>
"Oh that I could meet you often," said Naomi, "and
hear more about Jesus of Nazareth.  I never felt so
deeply interested on any subject, and I cannot endure to
think that I may hear of it no more.  I almost tremble
to propose it, as I know how heavy would be my father's
displeasure if I were discovered;&mdash;and yet I am resolved
to brave it.  Will you let me come to your home, when
I can do so unsuspected? and will you then let me listen
to all that you can tell me?  My parents are good and
indulgent, and I would not deceive them for any other
purpose; but I feel that there is something in your
story that concerns my soul, and God will pardon my
disobedience, while I am seeking to know his will."
</p>

<p>
We have said that Naomi was self-willed and impetuous:
her feelings were ardent and uncontrolled; and
in proportion to the contempt she entertained for the
Nazarenes while she was ignorant of the character of
Him whom they worshipped, was the admiration she
now felt when that character was in some degree displayed
to her, and the eagerness of her determination to
know more of this gracious and glorious Being.  She
clasped her hands, and fixed her bright black eyes on
Mary's countenance with a look so earnest and imploring,
that the aged disciple saw the work of God was begun in
her heart, and she doubted not that the work would be
completed.  She felt it to be a sacred duty to endeavour
to snatch this young creature from the errors and
prejudices which now obscured her mind, and lead her into
the pure light of the Gospel, even though the pious effort
was in opposition to the will of her mistaken parents.
By the blessing of God, the conversion of their child
might be the means of calling them also out of darkness
into His marvellous light.  She therefore readily
consented to receive her young friend whenever she could
contrive to visit her, and exhorted her to caution and
circumspection, as otherwise danger might befall them
both.
</p>

<p>
"For myself," she added, "it little matters how soon
the worn-out thread of my life is severed; but I would
not willingly shorten an existence which I may spend in
my Master's service, though to depart and be with Christ
would be much better.  And you, I trust, my child, may
have many years before you, in which to honour God,
and serve his Son Jesus Christ.  I cannot but believe
that you will be brought to a knowledge of his name, and
be an active and devoted servant of him whom once you
hated and despised.  Farewell, and may the blessing of
the God of Israel be with you, and the grace of his Son
Jesus Christ descend upon your heart."
</p>

<p>
Mary arose, and Naomi took her hand, which she
kissed affectionately and respectfully, and then they
advanced slowly to meet Deborah, who was hastening
towards them with considerable speed.
</p>

<p>
"I fear," she exclaimed, "that I have kept you very
long.  I thought you would have entered the village ere
this, and would have been tired of waiting for me; but I
was detained much longer than I expected: and now we
must hurry homewards, or your mother will be alarmed;
and Zadok too will be displeased with me for keeping
you out so late, if he returns from the evening service to
the temple and finds you are not yet at home."
</p>

<p>
"Is Zadok the priest your father then?" asked Mary,
with some anxiety; for she knew the strictness of his
character as a Pharisee, and his abhorrence of the
Christian name, and she feared that her young friend's
dawning faith might be put to a severe trial, and even be
extinguished, if Zadok ever obtained knowledge of it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Naomi, "I am his daughter, and I
glory in saying so; for whose character stands so high
as that of Zadok? and who is so kind and so good a
father as Zadok?  I would that you knew him, Mary."
</p>

<p>
"God bless you," again said the old woman; and they
separated.  She slowly bent her steps towards her humble
home at Bethany, and lifted up her heart in fervent
prayer for the soul of Naomi, who, with her nurse, rapidly
descended the mount, crossed the brook, and entering
the city, soon reached the abode of Zadok.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
</h3>

<p>
From the lofty battlements of Jotapata, Josephus and his
officers watched the close and endless files of the Roman
army slowly advancing along the straight and level road
that led to the city walls, and which had been formed by
the pioneers of Vespasian.  It was a fearful array of tried
and valiant troops, led on by the most celebrated general
of the time.  The Jews had relied on their inaccessible
position, their steep and rugged mountains, and the deep
forests that surrounded their fortress, for security.  What,
therefore, was their astonishment and consternation when
they saw the lofty trees falling around them, the rocks
removed, the mountains cut through, and Vespasian with
his whole army stationed on a hill within a mile of the
city!  The garrison were terror-struck, and retired
behind their walls; while the Romans, though weary with
their long march, and unprepared for an immediate
assault, employed themselves in drawing a triple line of
circumvallation round the city; so that every chance of
escape for the cowardly, who might wish to attempt it,
was effectually cut off.  Finding that retreat was
hopeless, the whole garrison recovered their wonted valour,
and resolved to hold out to the uttermost, and fight while
life remained.  Their fierce resistance and stubborn
resolution have seldom been equalled.
</p>

<p>
The following day they boldly left the shelter of their
walls, and, pitching their camp before the trenches,
advanced to meet the foe; and though galled by the archers
and slingers of the Roman army, they made so vigorous
a sally, that the assailants were driven down the hill.
The battle was continued with desperation, until the
darkness of night compelled them to separate, when
Josephus led his troops back to their stations.  Young
Javan and his companions distinguished themselves by
their determined bravery, which was not unobserved by
the Jewish commander; and henceforth he stationed
them near his own person, and employed Javan on many
important occasions.
</p>

<p>
The city was built on the summit of a lofty hill, and
on three sides was surrounded by ravines, so deep and
rugged as to be quite impassable.  It is said that the
depth of the chasm was in some parts so profound, that,
when looking from the summit of the walls, the eye could
not reach the bottom.  On these three sides, therefore,
Vespasian could not hope to gain an entrance; but, on
the north side, the city was more accessible, as the
hill sloped gradually down from the walls; and here he
resolved to raise a great embankment, from the top of
which his men could discharge their missiles into the
thickest ranks of the besieged.  The whole army laboured
at this work, defending themselves from the javelins and
arrows of the Jews by a roof of wicker-work that was
stretched over the workmen, and was strong enough even
to resist the great stones that were hurled down by their
enemies.  To clear the walls of these assailants, Vespasian
brought his military engines to bear on that point; and
soon the stones and javelins discharged by the balistæ
and catapults, and the yet more fearful balls of fire and
flaming arrows, fell among the garrison in showers.  The
battlements were deserted in that quarter, but the Jews
were not disheartened.  They descended from the walls,
and stole out in small parties on the workmen, destroying
their breastworks, and wounding many of those who had
laid aside their armour.  But notwithstanding all their
efforts to prevent it, the embankment was at length
completed, and brought almost to a level with the height of
their own walls, and their only resource was to raise the
battlements so as to command the works of the enemy.
To effect this, Josephus ordered strong poles to be fixed
on the top of the walls, and on these a sort of curtain
was fixed, of the hides of cattle, behind which the
soldiers could work in safety; and they succeeded in
raising the walls upwards of thirty feet.  He also erected
several towers, and otherwise strengthened the fortifications,
to the astonishment and dismay of the Romans,
who had flattered themselves that they should soon be
masters of the city.
</p>

<p>
They knew not yet the courage and obstinacy of the
Jews, or the ability and cunning of Josephus and his
officers.  Numerous were the sallies by which they
annoyed their besiegers, sometimes even setting fire to the
works they had but just erected, and destroying them.
On one of these occasions, Javan led forth a small party
of chosen men, and rushing upon the breastworks that
concealed the enemy, they succeeded in tearing down a
considerable portion, and wounding several Roman
soldiers, without themselves receiving any injury; when
the centurion who held the command of that band of
men, hearing the conflict, hastened to their assistance
and quickly restored order.  He marshalled his men,
and led them forward from the breastworks with so much
impetuosity, as entirely to check the assailants; and
directing his attack towards the young Jewish leader,
Javan recognised his old friend Rufus.  The centurion
remembered him, and for his father's sake he forbore to
press his advantage.  He would not take the son of Zadok
prisoner, or willingly injure him, though now an enemy;
and he allowed him and his followers to escape unhurt to
the walls.  Javan did not imitate his generous forbearance;
but as he fled he turned back, and cast a javelin
at his former friend with such strength and fury as to
shiver a portion of the armour in which he was encased,
and inflict a slight wound in his side.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" cried Rufus, "my mercy was ill-bestowed.  I
see that the same cruel and ungenerous spirit yet lives
in that young fanatic.  Forward, my brave men, and
teach him that it was not because we feared him that we
drew back."  The Romans swiftly obeyed the word of
their commander, and overtook the retreating party as
they reached the foot of the wall.  The portal from
whence they had sallied forth was closed; and ere it
could be opened by those within, a fierce struggle had
begun.  Several of the combatants on either side fell
dead, or severely wounded; and Javan received a serious
injury in his right arm, that left him defenceless, and
exposed to the sword of his antagonist.  The Roman
who had inflicted the wound was about to strike at him
with his short, double-edged blade, and his fierce spirit
would have been quenched for ever; but at that moment
a party of the garrison who had ascended the walls
hurled down a massive stone that struck the uplifted
arm of his assailant, and threw him with violence to the
ground.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord strikes for his people!" shouted Javan;
and snatching up the sword which had fallen to the earth,
he with his left hand plunged it to the heart of his foe.
Then turning away, he rushed through the now open
door, leaving his party to follow him as they could.
Similar skirmishes were often repeated, but they led to
no important results; and Vespasian determined at length
to blockade the city, and endeavour to reduce it by
famine, since all his assaults proved ineffectual.  He
therefore ordered his troops to remain quiet in their
quarters, and await the time when, reduced to starvation,
the garrison would either surrender, or fall a more easy
conquest to their renewed attacks.
</p>

<p>
The city contained a large supply of every necessary
except water; but there was no spring within the walls,
and the small quantity of rain-water that could be
obtained was quite inadequate to the wants of the garrison
and the rest of the inhabitants.  This was measured out
in very scanty portions, and after the blockade had been
continued for some days, many began to faint beneath
the severe privation, added to the fatigue they endured,
and the fever that parched up the wounded and the sick.
The Romans discovered their distress, and hoped for a
speedy surrender; but the wily Josephus resolved to
baffle their calculations, and he ordered a number of his
men to dip their clothes in water, and then hang them
over the walls, so that the moisture ran down; and the
besiegers could no longer believe that the garrison were
in want of water, when they could waste so much
unnecessarily.  Vespasian therefore resolved to renew the
assault, which was exactly what the Jews desired, for it
was better to perish by the sword than to die of thirst or
famine.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the close blockade kept up by the
Romans, Josephus still contrived to keep up a communication
with his friends without the city, by means of a
narrow and rugged path down the bed of a torrent.  It
was so precipitous and dangerous that the Romans left it
unguarded; and by this difficult way the messengers of
the Jewish commander crept forth on their hands and
knees, covered with skins of animals, and thus bearing
letters to other towns, and bringing back many articles
of great service to the besieged.  But at length this was
discovered, and all further exit by this passage was
prevented.  Josephus now began to despair of success, and
even held a council with the chief persons in the city as
to the possibility of effecting their own escape.  This was
discovered by the inhabitants, and they hastened to throw
themselves at his feet, imploring him not to abandon
them to the Roman vengeance.  He was moved with
pity at the sight of the terrified multitude of men,
women, and children kneeling before him, and consented
to relinquish his selfish purpose; and seizing the moment
when they were filled with gratitude, he exclaimed.
"Now is the time, then; if there is no hope of safety
let us exert our utmost courage, and let us at least die
nobly, and leave behind us a glorious example!"  The
most courageous of his soldiers gathered round him, and
they rushed forth, carrying fire and sword into the
enemy's lines.  For three days these fierce sallies were
repeated, and kept up a constant state of watchfulness
and alarm in the Roman camp.
</p>

<p>
Vespasian, weary of this desultory warfare, now
ordered the battering-ram to be brought against the
walls.  This tremendous engine was composed of an
enormous beam of wood, terminating in the head of a
ram, cast in iron; this was hung by ropes from another
strong beam, supported by four tall posts.  When it was
required to exert its terrible force, it was drawn
backwards by a number of men, and then driven forward with
a shock, against which scarcely any wall could resist.
This dreadful machine now slowly advanced against the
walls of Jotapata, and the smaller engines commenced a
quick discharge of stones and darts, to drive the Jews
from the walls.  Then began the thundering blows of
the battering-ram, and the walls shook to their foundation.
A cry rose from the city, for all the inhabitants
believed that the Romans were even now entering their
streets.  Still was Josephus able to parry this new danger.
He ordered a great number of bags to be stuffed with
chaff, and suspended on the face of the wall, so as to
meet and break the force of the ram; and this scheme
entirely succeeded, to the great astonishment of the
Romans.  They however continued to sever the ropes
to which the bags were tied, by means of sickles fastened
to long poles, and then they recommenced their work of
destruction.  But the Jews rushed forth from their gates
in three bodies, armed with flaming torches and every
combustible they could seize.  They set fire to the
engines and the palisades, and drove back their
assailants, who were confounded by the fire and smoke.
Among the foremost was the fierce Javan, brandishing
a flaming brand in his left hand, and carrying destruction
and dismay wherever he turned.  All the endeavours of
the Romans to save their works were ineffectual; they
suffered a great loss of men in the engagement, and all
that had cost them such labour and ingenuity to erect
was in less than one hour reduced to ashes.
</p>

<p>
One man among the Jews distinguished himself by an
act of desperate courage, that has made his name
memorable even to the present time.  This was Eleazer, the
son of Samæas, a Galilean, who standing on the wall at
the time of the furious sally made by Josephus, took up
an enormous stone, and hurled it at the head of the
battering-ram with such force, that it broke off, and fell to
the ground.  He then descended from the wall and
rushed forth into the midst of the enemy, and seizing on
the ram's head, carried it off in triumph.  The Romans,
filled with indignation, cast at him a shower of darts and
arrows, five or six of which entered his body: he
nevertheless still bore off his prize, and carried it to the top
of the wall, where he undauntedly showed himself and
his trophy to the infuriated foe.  But the wounds he had
received were mortal, and sinking beneath them, he fell
from the wall with the head of the ram still grasped in
his dying hands.  His heroic example animated his comrades
with fresh courage, and they succeeded in destroying
all the engines, and coverings, and breastworks of
the fifth and tenth legions, which, notwithstanding their
high reputation for bravery and discipline, had fled,
confounded by the fierce desperation of their assailants, and
blinded by the smoke and flame.
</p>

<p>
Still the Romans were not discouraged; and in the
dusk of the evening they once more erected their terrible
battering-ram against that part of the fortifications that
was already shaken by its force; but during this operation
one of the besieged cast a javelin from the wall, and
pierced the neck of Vespasian.  The Romans seeing their
general wounded, were greatly discouraged, and his son
Titus betrayed the deepest concern and alarm; but his
father quickly removed their fears, and reappearing
among his troops, those who had fled in dismay returned
to their duty with fresh animation, and showed a
determination to brave every danger in the hope of revenging
the insult offered to their beloved general; and with a
unanimous shout of defiance, they rushed upon the wall.
The stones, darts, and arrows flew in showers upon the
besieged, and many fell beneath the deadly strokes; yet
others pressed forward to take their places, and in their
turn poured fire and stones and pieces of iron upon the
besiegers, who worked beneath their hurdles.  The fires
that burnt around shed a lurid light on this work of
death, and guided the aim of the Jews on the walls; but
the Romans were unable to distinguish their enemies
above them.  Nevertheless they continued to pour forth
their missiles; and so vast were the stones that were
thrown by the balistæ, and so resistless was their force,
that they broke through the thickest ranks of the
defenders, and striking against the towers and inner walls,
brought down heavy pieces of masonry upon the crowds
around.  One man who stood between Javan and the
Jewish commander had his head torn from his shoulders,
and carried away to the distance of three furlongs.  That
was indeed a fearful night.  The terrible and continued
noise of the engines, the shouts of the soldiers, the
screams of the women and children in the city, the
groans of the wounded and dying, and the heavy crash
of armour on the wall as the slain fell one upon another,
formed a deafening and discordant sound that can hardly
be conceived, and which was echoed back from the
surrounding mountains; while the blood ran in streams
from the walls, and stood in pools around their base.
Until the morning watch the walls stood firm; but then
they yielded before the battering-ram, and a breach was
formed.  Vespasian gave his wearied men a short respite
before he led them on to storm the breach; then posting
a strong body of cavalry entirely covered with armour
at the foot of the wall, he commanded the infantry to
apply the scaling-ladders.  Josephus was not idle within;
he stationed the least efficient of the garrison on those
parts of the walls that were not immediately threatened;
but all the best and bravest he disposed in front of the
breach; and in the most perilous situation of all he
stationed himself and Javan and four others, with directions
to stop their ears against the noise of the legionaries,
and receive their darts on their bended knees, with their
shields locked together over their heads, until their
quivers were exhausted, and then to sally forth and fall
upon them with all their collected rage, and fight for
their lives and their liberties, and those of their wives
and children and aged parents.  The women seeing the
dreadful preparations on either side, gave themselves up
for lost, and one wild dismal cry of anguish and despair
burst from the crowded streets; but Josephus dreading
the effect of their grief and consternation on the soldiers,
ordered them all to be locked up in the houses, and with
severe threats commanded them to be still.
</p>

<p>
Now the trumpets sounded for the charge, and the
Romans gave a mighty shout, at the same moment sending
upon the besieged such a cloud of arrows and darts
that the air was darkened.  Josephus's brave companions
followed his directions, and stopped their ears to the
sound, and defended their bodies from the darts.  But as
soon as the engines had played, and ere the engineers
could renew the charge, they sallied forth upon them
resolving to slay or be slain, and were followed by many
other parties animated with the same desperate
resolution.  But the Romans at length drove them back, and
succeeded in getting a footing on the wall.  Josephus
had now recourse to stratagem in this extremity, and
ordered a quantity of oil to be heated, which, being
quickly prepared, was poured in a boiling state on their
assailants, and penetrating through the joints of their
armour, burnt through their flesh, and maddened them
with agony, so that, being unable to tear off their
armour, they turned back and fled away, carrying
confusion among their comrades; and many of them fell
headlong from the narrow bridges by which they had
passed to the walls from their embankment.  The Jews
also poured boiled fenugreek, a kind of herb, on the
planks and bridges by which their enemies ascended, and
thus made them so slippery that it was impossible for
them to stand upright, and many fell with violence to
the ground, and in that situation were struck at by those
on the walls.
</p>

<p>
In the evening, Vespasian was forced to call off his
discomfited men, of whom a great number were wounded,
besides those who lay dead on the field.  The loss of the
Jotapateans was considerably less, and they were greatly
encouraged by the result of that day.  The Romans now
commenced raising their mounds to a greater height,
and also erected three strong and lofty towers, in which
were placed bowmen and slingers to keep up a perpetual
annoyance of the garrison; and they in their turn made
frequent sallies, with no decisive effect, until, on the
forty-seventh day of the siege, the enemy raised their
works above the level of the walls, and looked down
upon the devoted inhabitants.  On that same fatal day,
treachery effected what force and valour had so long
failed to accomplish.  One dastardly man was found
mean enough to creep out of the city and desert to
Vespasian, and inform him of the weak and distressed
state of the garrison and the inhabitants of Jotapata.
He urged him to make a sudden attack upon the place
during the last watch of the night, when, worn out with
fighting and watching, the garrison would be in a
profound sleep, and even the sentinels would probably be
slumbering also, so weary and faint were they now
become.  At first Vespasian doubted the traitor's story,
and thought it was only a stratagem of Josephus to
ensnare him; and this suspicion was strengthened by
the fidelity and constancy which had hitherto been
displayed by the Jotapateans who had fallen into their
hands.  One man had even endured the sharpest torments
by fire, which had been applied by the Romans to
induce him to disclose the secrets of the garrison; and,
smiling at their cruel efforts, had afterwards patiently
sustained the tortures of crucifixion.  Vespasian,
however, believed that the consequences to his mighty army
could be but trifling, even if he were deceived; he therefore
kept the deserter in close custody, and gave orders
for attacking the city.
</p>

<p>
At the hour mentioned by the traitor, his troops
advanced silently to the walls, and Titus led a small party
of the fifth legion to the summit.  Here they instantly
slew the sentinels before an alarm could be raised, and
then quietly entered the city, followed by Placidus and
Sextus Cerialis, with Rufus the centurion, and the men
under their command.  They seized upon the citadel,
and, favoured by a thick mist and the drowsiness of the
inhabitants, they were in the very heart of the city
before the garrison had been aroused to their danger.
The entrance of the whole Roman army then showed
them the extent of their misfortune, and the furious and
indiscriminate slaughter which commenced proved that
their enemies remembered all they had suffered in the
siege, and were determined to revenge it.  They charged
down from the citadel, hewing down all who opposed
them, and driving the terrified inhabitants into the
narrow streets and lanes, where they fell an unresisting
prey to their enemies, while many were pushed over the
steep precipices by the force of the crowd behind them,
and dashed to pieces.  A few of the most resolute
gathered round Josephus, and several of them, seeing
the hopelessness of their situation, died by their own and
by each other's hands, rather than be slain by the enemy.
A party of the guard fled to a tower, and there made
some resistance; but they were soon surrounded and
forced to surrender; and the Romans became entire
masters of the celebrated city of Jotapata, with the loss
of but one of their men.  This was a centurion named
Antonius, who was slain by an act of cunning.  One of
the Jews, who had taken refuge in a cave, held out his
hand to him, promising to surrender if he would assist
him to clamber out.  Antonius took his hand, and at that
moment the other struck him through the throat with
his spear and killed him instantly.
</p>

<p>
The city was given up that day to a general slaughter,
and all who were seen in the houses and streets were put
to the sword.  The following day a strict search was
made in the caves and hiding-places, where multitudes
had taken refuge, and of these the men were slain, and
the women and children reserved as prisoners.  About
twelve hundred were collected to be carried away into
captivity, and it is supposed that nearly forty thousand
were slain from the commencement of the attack on the
city.  Vespasian then ordered the city to be burnt to
the ground, and all its boasted towers and walls were
quickly reduced to ashes.
</p>

<p>
Josephus had been sought for in vain during the
carnage; no pains were spared to discover and capture
him, who was the chief object of the siege, and who had
excited the resentment of the Romans and their general
by the obstinacy of his resistance.  On the taking of the
city, when he saw that all other hope of safety was gone,
he had leaped down a dry well, from the bottom of which
he knew that a long passage led to a subterranean cave,
entirely concealed from the view of those above.  Here
he found forty men of consequence and note, and among
them his young friend Javan, who had all sought refuge
in this secure retreat, and with them was one woman,
the wife of a citizen of the party.  These persons had
hastily collected, and carried down to the cave, a
sufficient quantity of provisions to sustain them for several
days; and Javan being separated from his general, and
hopeless of any success by further resistance, had joined
them, and shared their place of concealment.  Josephus
remained in the cave during the day, but at night he
ascended, accompanied by Javan, and sought to effect
his escape; but finding every avenue strictly guarded,
he was compelled to return to the cave.  The third
night he was attended by the citizen's wife, who promised
to point out to him a secret way by which he could
escape; but she had deceived him, and as soon as she had
conducted him within hearing of the sentinels, she fled
from him, and betrayed to the soldiers where he made
his hiding-place.  This was immediately made known
to Vespasian, who sent two tribunes, named Paulinus
and Gallicanus, to persuade him to surrender.  He had
returned to the cave, and was startled by hearing his
own name loudly called from the top of the well; and
the tribunes proceeded to deliver to him their general's
offer of mercy.  But Josephus had no dependence on
the mercy of the Romans, and refused to come up, till
Vespasian sent another tribune, named Nicanor, with
whom he was well acquainted, and who, by various
arguments and promises, at length induced him to
consent.
</p>

<p>
But the Jews, who were in the cave with him now
opposed this resolution, and reproached him severely for
his cowardice and fear of death, which could induce him
to give himself up voluntarily to the Romans.  They
reminded him how often he had exhorted them to die
rather than submit to their enemies, and how many of
their fellow-citizens and soldiers had already done so;
and they declared that if he could forget his own
honour, they would take care that he did not disgrace
their country.  They therefore gave him his choice,
whether he would die nobly and voluntarily by their
hands, and be for ever remembered with honour as
the valiant general of the Jews, or persist in his intention
and be slain as a traitor, which they declared should
be his fate the moment he attempted to go forth to the
tribunes.  And, saying this, they surrounded him with
their naked swords, and awaited his reply.
</p>

<p>
Josephus now exerted all his wonted eloquence, in the
effort to save his own life, and to persuade his companions
to join him in surrendering to the conquerors.  But
however ingenious his arguments and powerful his appeals,
they failed to move his auditors, who were only the more
enraged at him, and rushed against him with their
swords.  He stood like a wild beast at bay, parrying the
strokes of some, calling on others by name, entreating,
commanding, imploring.
</p>

<p>
"Javan!" he cried, "do you join to murder your
general? you, who have fought so bravely by my side,
and gloried in my approbation.  If these Galileans
would take away my life, will you, a true-born Jew,
desert me?"
</p>

<p>
Javan regarded him at that moment with a feeling of
pity and contempt.  He dropped his sword, and his
example was followed by the rest, some of whom still
entertained a regard for the general, who had hitherto
displayed such wisdom and courage in the defence of
their town.  He seized the favourable moment, and
exclaimed, "If you are resolved to die, let us cast lots
who shall first be slain.  Thus each will suffer death in
turn; and yet none incur the guilt of dying by his own
hand.  It would be dishonourable in me to survive, if
all the rest are determined to perish."  This proposal
was readily acceded to, for all believed that Josephus
would share the same fate with themselves.  The lots
were cast, and one by one these undaunted men offered
their breasts to the sword of him who was doomed to be
his executioner.  Whether by chance, or, which is more
probable, by artifice, so it was that the lot fell not on
Josephus, until all were slain except himself and one
other.  That other was young Javan; and his fierce
spirit did not shrink from enduring the death which he
had just inflicted on the last of his companions.  But his
general felt equally repugnant thus in cold blood either
to slay a fellow-creature, or to submit to the stroke of
death from him; and promising him his future friendship,
he at length so worked on the young man's feelings
and natural love of life, that he agreed to ascend
with him and submit to the promised clemency of
Vespasian.
</p>

<p>
Nicanor immediately led them to the general, while
all the Romans crowded round to obtain a sight of this
distinguished man.  Many from a distance cried out
that he should be punished with death; but those who
stood near, and regarded his fallen countenance, were
touched with pity for his misfortunes, and admiration of
his great and noble exploits; and Titus, above all the
rest, was filled with sympathy for the captive.  He
persuaded his father to grant Josephus his life; but he was
kept closely guarded, and it was supposed he would be
sent immediately to Rome to the Emperor Nero.  Josephus
dreaded this event, and in the hope of avoiding it,
he entreated a private interview with Vespasian; and
all having withdrawn, except Titus and two other friends,
he declared that it was not from a love of life that he had
given himself up to the Romans, but because he was
commissioned to announce to Vespasian and his son that
they were appointed to succeed to the imperial dignity.
He then implored that he might not be sent to Nero,
but be kept in chains, if it was thought necessary, until
his prediction was fulfilled; for he acknowledged, that if
he should be found guilty of having deceived his
conqueror in the name of the God of Israel, he should
deserve a worse punishment than captivity.
</p>

<p>
Vespasian was struck with the prophetic promises of
the captive; yet suspecting his sincerity, he asked him
how it was that if he could foretell future events, he had
not foreseen the fall of Jotapata and his own captivity,
and sought to avert the calamity.  Josephus replied
that he had repeatedly warned the Jotapateans of their
coming fate, and told them that they would hold out the
siege for forty-seven days, when they would be
conquered, and he himself taken prisoner.  On this
declaration the Roman general caused inquiry to be made
among the prisoners as to its truth; when they asserted
that such prophecies had actually been pronounced by
their leader.  Whether this was really the case or not,
we cannot now determine; but it had the effect of
impressing on Vespasian's mind the prediction of his
own future greatness; and though he did not set the
prophet at liberty, he treated him with great kindness,
and made him several valuable presents.  Javan also
was kept in strict captivity with the other prisoners
who were reserved either for sale or as domestic slaves
to their conquerors.  The rough but kind-hearted Rufus
visited him frequently, and took many opportunities of
adding to his comforts, and enlivening his spirits by his
conversation and encouragement.  But he could not
resist reminding Javan of the unworthy return he had
once made to his forbearance and friendship, when he
wounded him so ungratefully after his sally from the
walls.  "Methinks," he said, "that the generosity and
virtue of one whom you call a heathen, has shown itself
to be superior to the boasted religion of the Jews; for
I forgive you, and come to your relief, and you sought
to slay me at the moment when I forbore to injure
you."
</p>

<p>
This reproach cut the proud self-righteous Pharisee
to the heart, but he could not reply to it; and Rufus
changed the subject, to talk to him of their mutual
friends at Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Would to God there were among ourselves no nominal
Christians, who by their cruel and vindictive, or otherwise
unchristian spirit, give occasion to the enemies of
our holy religion to speak evil of that which they
profess, but do not follow.  But even as they were not true
children of Abraham, who trusted to themselves that
they were righteous,&mdash;and, while indulging pride and
cruelty, and revenge, yet despised others,&mdash;neither are
we all Christians who are called by the name of Christ,
if we seek not to imitate the charity, and meekness, and
holiness, and love that shone forth in the life of our
Master and Redeemer.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
</h3>

<p>
It was on the sabbath-day that the intelligence of the
fall of Jotapata, and the massacre of the garrison and
inhabitants, reached Jerusalem; and the dreadful news
brought grief and consternation into the city.  Their
chief warrior, on whom they depended as the leader of
their armies, was reported to have fallen; their choicest
troops were slain; and one of the strongest of the
Galilean fortresses destroyed.  But though the dejection
and sorrow were general, yet in some families it was
more profound and heartfelt, for they had lost a son, a
brother, or a husband among the Jewish troops.  In
Zadok's house the sound of mourning and woe was
heard, for it was believed that Javan was slain.  He
had joined the army of Josephus, and was known to be
present at the siege of Jotapata; and as all the garrison
as well as the inhabitants were reported to be massacred,
his parents, his sister, and the faithful old Deborah wept
and lamented for him as dead, with all the vehemence,
and the deep demonstrations of grief, that were always
exhibited by the ancient Jews, and still distinguish the
inhabitants of the East in all cases of severe affliction.
Javan's faults were now forgotten, and it was only
remembered that he was a son and a brother; and even Claudia,
who had never loved him, was filled with sorrow at the
thought of his untimely and cruel death.  Zadok sought
in vain to console his weeping family; while his own
heart was torn with grief for his lost son, and saddened
at the unhappy prospects of his ill fated country.
</p>

<p>
But while he was absorbed in gloomy thoughts, the
trumpets of the temple sounded long and loud, and
reminded him that it was the hour for the evening
sacrifice, and that he must lay aside all worldly feelings,
and go forth to minister in the Lord's house.  It was
his turn that day to officiate at the altar in the order of
his course; and no private business or private sorrow
must be allowed to interfere with his holy office.  He
therefore performed the necessary ablutions and
purifications, and assumed his priestly robes.  The trumpets
sounded again, and he set forth towards the temple;
and ere he had ascended the broad flight of steps that
led to the outer court, the third and last summons pealed
forth, and echoed from the hills around, to call the
inhabitants and the throngs of priests and Levites to
worship in that glorious house of God.  The cheerfulness
and peace which usually marked the weekly festival
of the Jewish sabbath, had been interrupted and clouded
that day by the news from Jotapata; and the crowds of
rich and poor, old and young, master and slave, who
had met without the gates to enjoy the day of rest, and
indulge, according to their custom, in social intercourse,
had hurried into the city to listen to the gloomy tidings.
The dismay and sorrow that had stricken so many
families prevented the temple service from being so
numerously attended as usual, and delayed the arrival
of the congregation; so that Zadok entered the outer
court (or court of the Gentiles), and found the spacious
area nearly deserted.  His spirit was sad, and he walked
slowly through the pillared cloisters that surrounded the
court, and led to the stately dwellings of the priests and
ministering officers of the temple.  Beneath the alabaster
porticoes and colonnades were the seats where the elders
and sages passed much of their time in instructing the
people, but they were now unoccupied.  He passed on
to the inner or holy temple, and looked with melancholy
pride and admiration on the marble walls, the gold and
silver gates, the ornaments of clustering grapes, and
pomegranates of glittering gold and brass, the cedar
roofs, and splendid hangings of purple and scarlet, and
the altars of rich incense that filled the air with the
most exquisite perfumes, and his naturally sanguine
spirit was depressed.  Even he felt that the power of
the Romans was becoming irresistible, and that ere long,
flushed with their Galilean victories, they would appear
before the walls of Jerusalem.  With their divided and
ill-governed troops, how could the Jews hope to resist
their countless and well-disciplined forces? and should
they once more gain access into the holy and beloved
city, urged on by revenge and fury, where would their
ravages cease? and what would be the fate of the sacred
building in which he stood?  Its beauty and its sanctity
might fail to preserve it from the destroying hands of
the idolaters, though every son of Israel were to shed
his blood in its defence.
</p>

<p>
Zadok strove to shake off these dismal forebodings,
so unusual to his heroic and exalted character; for,
relying on the arm of Jehovah, and believing the Jews
to be his only and peculiar people, he seldom admitted
a thought that any serious calamity would be permitted
to fall on them.  He approached the altar of sacrifice,
now surrounded by the gathering crowd, and took
from the hands of the attending Levites the appointed
victims, two being always prepared for the sabbath
offering.  He slew them, and presented them before
the Lord with all the accustomed forms; and while the
smoke of the altar ascended in a cloud of the richest
incense, he looked forward in faith to that Messiah,
of whom he knew these sacrifices were but the type,
and whom he believed in his blindness had not yet
appeared on the earth to take away sin, and redeem
his people.  But though Zadok was in error, yet his
piety was sincere and fervent, and his soul was
comforted by the sacred service and the holy worship;
so that he returned to his house with a more cheerful
countenance.
</p>

<p>
But sorrow and dismay had taken possession of the
city, and for thirty days the voice of wailing was heard
in Jerusalem.  Almost every family was called to mourn
some private calamity, in the loss of their friends and
relations who had fallen at Jotapata; while all united
in deploring the death of Josephus as a heavy national
affliction; and musicians were hired to perform funeral
chants to his memory.  The chiefs and elders met in
frequent council, to devise what measures should be
adopted for checking the further progress of the Romans:
but their assemblies were generally broken up in wrath
and violence, for among the contending parties who
exercised power and tyranny in the unhappy city, none
could be found to unite cordially for the general good;
and nothing effectual was determined on.  Zadok attended
several of these councils, and endeavoured by his manly
good sense and acute judgment, to lead the conflicting
chiefs to lay aside their private quarrels, and join heart
and hand for the common defence of their country; but
his voice was unheeded, and jealousy and passion reigned
supreme.  So violent were some of the parties on one
occasion, that at length he departed from the scene of
tumult, and hastened to his home, where yet he could
enjoy domestic peace and tranquillity.
</p>

<p>
Naomi met him as he entered the vestibule, and he
was astonished at seeing her lovely face radiant with
smiles of joy.  She knelt before him with the graceful
veneration which was always expected from the children
of the ancient Israelites towards their parents when
demanding their blessing, on their return from the temple,
or on any other solemn occasion; and her father fondly
laid his hands on her glossy and raven hair, and
pronounced the customary benediction, "God make thee
as Sarah, and Rebecca, and Rachel, and Leah;" thus
using the words of the patriarch Jacob, but substituting
the names of those favoured women of Ephraim and
Manasseh, as the blessing was addressed to a female.
Naomi then sprang up, and threw herself into the arms
of her father, exclaiming, "Javan is alive! my brother
is safe!  Oh let us praise the Lord for his goodness!"
</p>

<p>
She was quickly followed by Salome, who with tears of
joy and gratitude presented to Zadok a letter from their
friend Rufus, and informed him that a special messenger
had arrived with the letter immediately after his
departure for the temple.  It was accompanied by one to
Claudia, which had declared its contents, and given them
the happy intelligence of Javan's preservation and safety;
but they had waited impatiently for Zadok's return, to
satisfy their curiosity as to all the particulars of his fate.
Their joy was greatly clouded when they found that he
was a prisoner in the Roman camp, though Rufus assured
them that he was kindly treated, and that there was a
hope of his being released if the Jews submitted, and
any exchange of prisoners took place.  But Zadok knew
that of such an event there was not the slightest
probability, as the Jews were resolved to resist the Roman
power to the very uttermost; and his own national pride
and desire for the independence of his people were so
great, that even to procure the freedom of his son, he
could not bring himself to hope for their submission.  He
did not however communicate these reflections to his wife
and daughter; and he joined with them in their joy and
gratitude that Javan's life was spared.
</p>

<p>
Rufus had hoped that his messenger would have reached
Jerusalem before the sad tidings of the fall of Jotapata
were known there, and that thus his friends would be
spared the shock of believing that their son had fallen in
the general massacre; but it had required some trouble
and ingenuity to convey his letters into the hands of a
trustworthy Jew, who would undertake to deliver them to
Zadok, as of course none of his own Roman troops could
go on such an errand; and ere all this could be arranged,
the intelligence had flown to the capital.  The packet
contained also a letter from Marcellus to Claudia, which
had been sent from Rome by a friend of his, who was
ordered to join the camp with a reinforcement of troops,
and Rufus had now forwarded it to his daughter.  As
we have heard but little of the proceedings of the
young Roman, we will here give the substance of his
letter:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It is a long time, my dearest Claudia, since I have
found means of writing to you; and I now gladly avail
myself of the departure of a body of soldiers to Galilee,
one of whom is a valued friend of mine, and will safely
convey my letter.  When last I heard from you, you
mentioned the probability of your going to our old friends
at Jerusalem; and I rejoiced to think that you would
again enjoy their society, and be in peace and safety
under their happy roof.  How few of their nation are so
free from prejudice and superstition as to admit a Roman
maiden into their house as a member of the family!
Javan alone will make your residence there in any way
irksome, for if he is not greatly changed, he will almost
scorn to eat at the same table with a Gentile.  But our
dear Naomi and the kind gentle Salome will be to you
is a sister and a mother, now that you are bereft of your
own beloved parent; and Zadok is too generous and too
high-minded to suffer you to be slighted while under his
protection.  Oh that I were with you, my sister!  All
the magnificence and gaiety of Rome do not compensate
me for being so far removed from all whom I have loved
from childhood; and I often think with regret of the
happy hours I have passed with you and Naomi among
the groves and gardens of Judea.  I rejoice to say that
my time of probation is almost over, and I shall soon be
enrolled among the soldiers of Rome, and sent to join one
of the legions now on duty abroad.  Our uncle Sulpitius
has much interest with the emperor, and he promises to
get me appointed to the tenth legion, which is commanded
by the noble Titus, and is now in Galilee, forming part
of the great army with which Vespasian hopes ere long
to quell the Jewish rebellion.  I shall then be with my
father, and also shall hope to see you, and possibly Naomi
also, for the war cannot last much longer.  The Jews
must soon submit to the overwhelming power of Rome;
and I trust they will do so before much more blood is
shed, and before Vespasian leads his troops against
Jerusalem itself, which is said here to be his intention.  What
would be my feelings, if as a Roman soldier I was forced
to assist in the capture of the place where our dear Naomi
and all her family dwell, and to fight against her father,
and her brother!  You, my sister, would of course be
removed to some safe refuge; but I know that Zadok
would remain to counsel and aid his countrymen; and
Naomi's devoted spirit would never allow her to seek
safety in any other spot, while her father, her mother, and
her beloved city, were exposed to danger.  Oh! that her
valiant and patriotic people may yet be wise in time, and
by a prudent submission avert the fearful calamities
which may otherwise overtake them!  Their further
resistance will only exasperate the emperor and his
generals yet more and more, and bring a heavier ruin on
their heads.  My heart is in Jerusalem; and while I
glory in being a Roman, I feel that Jerusalem is still my
home, and the place where I would wish to dwell.  This
is a glorious and magnificent city, even surpassing all
my expectations.  You, I think, must have quite
forgotten the city where you were born, for even I had but
a faint recollection of some of the chief streets; and
everything seemed strange to me when I returned,
except my uncle's house and his extensive garden, where
we used to play in our childhood with our cousin Camillus.
Whenever I enter this lonely spot I feel at home again;
and such recollections rush to my mind of my dear
mother, that I can hardly believe she is departed, and
that I shall see her no more.  May her spirit be blessed
wherever it now dwells!
</p>

<p>
"You know that the house in which we lived in Rome
has been destroyed, and a noble temple dedicated to
Mercury new occupies the place where it stood.  Doubtless
you will suppose that thither I often bend my steps
and pay my vows; but, Claudia, it is not so.  I live in
the capital of the gods of Rome; and wherever I turn
I behold splendid fanes, and rich altars, and exquisite
sculptures set up in honour of these countless deities; but
I have ceased to bow my knee to any of them.  Yet do
not suppose, that like so many of my young countrymen,
in discovering the fallacy and absurdity of the system in
which I had been educated, I have cast off all belief, and
become an infidel.  No, I have learnt to worship the one
true God of heaven and earth; and tell your friend Naomi
that henceforth she must not think of Marcellus as a
blind idolater, who bows down to images of wood and
stone, but a sincere worshipper of Jehovah.  And yet
I do not declare myself a Jew, for many of the Jewish
rites and ceremonies still seem to me but folly; and I
have been instructed in many things that I would wish to
communicate to you, but I dare not until we meet.  Oh,
Claudia, let a brother's entreaties and a brother's example
induce you to embrace a better faith than that which now
you hold.  Listen to the words of Naomi, and she will tell
you of the power, and wisdom, and love of our great
Creator, who is far above all gods; and may He enlighten
your mind to see in Him the true Deity, and lead you to
despise those gods that are the work of men's hands, and
have no power to do either good or evil.
</p>

"Through His mercy I became acquainted with an
aged man, learned in the Scriptures and full of piety and
holiness.  His arguments have convinced me of the folly
of idolatry, and the happiness of putting all our trust in
the Almighty Jehovah.  I beseech you to read those holy
Scriptures with care and diligence, and by the blessing of
God you will learn the truth; and then when I see you,
my sister, I will impart to you what further knowledge I
have received from my venerable friend.  He has many
scholars here, but he is hated and despised by the Romans,
as the doctrines that he teaches, and the mode of life
that he inculcates and follows, are in direct opposition to
the absurd faith and luxurious lives of the people of this
great but wicked city.  Nero especially holds in
abhorrence both the Jews and those who attend the teaching
of my instructor.  All his time is devoted to amusement
or to cruelty; and on the Nazarenes, who are numerous
in Rome, he wreaks his vengeance with an unsparing
hand, whenever they are discovered and dragged before
him.  You will shudder when I tell you of the dreadful
treatment which some of these unhappy people have met
with lately.

"A party of them were discovered and accused before
the emperor of being followers of Jesus of Nazareth; and
they boldly avowed the charge, and declared their resolution
to endure all things that could be inflicted on them,
but never to deny the name of Jesus.  The indignation of
Nero was excited at their undaunted reply, and he determined
to employ the severest cruelty, in order to force
them to submit to his commands, and to bow down to an
idol.  But nothing could shake their firmness, and they
were given over to death in its most hideous forms.
Some of them were enclosed in the skins of beasts, and
turned into the Circus, and torn to pieces by dogs.
Others were crucified; and to increase their torments,
they were insulted and mocked in their dying agonies.
And worse than all, when the public games were
performed in the emperor's own gardens, and the populace
were admitted to see them, some of these miserable
Christians were covered with wax and other combustibles,
and fixed in different parts of the gardens, with a sharp
stake placed under their chin to keep them upright, and
in that situation they were set on fire, and burnt alive to
serve as flambeaux to light the spectators!  My blood
boils while I describe these enormities, which doubtless
will call down a judgment on those who perpetrated
them, and on this guilty city; though many of the
inhabitants were filled with pity and indignation at the
eight of such sufferings, and would have endeavoured to
obtain the pardon of the Nazarenes, had not the character
of Nero and his violent and bloody temper deterred them
from the attempt.  Think not that I witnessed these
executions.  Camillus would have dragged me to the
gardens, but I left him, and fled from the city in horror
and disgust.  I grieve to say that he witnessed and
enjoyed the revolting spectacle; though his natural
refinement of disposition would, I should have imagined,
have deterred him, even if no feelings of humanity
existed in his heart.  Unhappily he is devoted to the
worst species of philosophy; and disregards all religion
and all care for the good of mankind, making his own
individual enjoyment the sole object of his existence.
He believes that when he dies his spirit will be totally
annihilated, and that therefore it is the highest wisdom to
seize on every enjoyment now within his grasp, and
think not of the future.  He passes much of his time in
the schools of the Epicurean philosophers, whose doctrines
he finds agreeable, and many of whom are certainly men
of great abilities, and capable of giving useful instruction
on every subject unconnected with religion.  On my first
arrival in Rome, I frequented their schools with Camillus,
and the charm of their eloquence almost beguiled me
into adopting their opinions; but, happily for me, my
acquaintance with the old teacher whom I have mentioned
already, occurred in time to save me from such
pernicious doctrines.
</p>

<p>
"I also accompanied our cousin to the amphitheatres
and other public exhibitions; but they soon wearied me,
and the barbarity of the combats of the gladiators, and
the cruel struggles of condemned criminals with wild
beasts, shocked and disgusted me; and notwithstanding
the ridicule of Camillus and his equally thoughtless
companions, I have ceased to attend these spectacles.
Indeed I usually seize the opportunity of my uncle and
cousin being thus engaged, for repairing to the humble
dwelling of my beloved teacher, where I listen to his
words of truth and piety with untiring and increasing
attention.
</p>

<p>
"In this luxurious city, the house of Sulpitius is
remarkable for its simplicity and absence of all ornament.
He prides himself on preserving the same frugality and
modesty in his dwelling and establishment that so
peculiarly distinguished the ancient Romans in the days of
the Republic.  He extends this simplicity to every part
of his domestic life, and it is only when he takes his place
as a senator that he assumes such robes as are suitable to
his rank and wealth; on all other occasions his attire is
plain, even to singularity, and forms a contrast to the
splendid and expensive attire of Camillus, who is permitted
to indulge all his tastes and fancies to the utmost,
though so widely differing from those of his father.  The
increasing luxury and refinement of the Romans is a
source of deep grief to Sulpitius: but he feels that it is
in vain to attempt to check it, even in his own son;
and with a few of his friends who still retain their virtue
and simplicity of manners, he bewails the corruption of
the times.  The sumptuous golden palace of Nero
excites his highest indignation, as an example of
extravagance and lavish indulgence that will be pernicious to
the whole nation.  It is indeed a splendid edifice, and
fitted up with gold and silver, and marble and precious
stones, and Babylonian carpets, as if almost to vie with
the temple at Jerusalem.  But nothing has excited my
admiration and wonder more than the aqueducts and the
public roads, which I have seen in my excursions in
the neighbourhood.  The roads are carried in a direct
line from the city, as a grand centre, to the towns
around, and I hear that they extend through great
part of the Roman dominions.  All obstacles are made
to give way; hills are levelled, and valleys filled up,
and bold arches thrown over streams and rivers.  The
middle of the road is raised to a considerable height,
with a mixture of sand and gravel united into a solid
mass with a powerful and durable cement, and this
terrace is then paved with large hewn stones, so well laid
together that I imagine they must last as long as the
world endures.  There are houses established at every
five or six miles' distance, which are constantly supplied
with forty horses for the use of travellers, and on any
urgent occasion the messengers of the emperor travel
along these roads at a rate of a hundred miles a-day.
All this is a fine effect of Roman power and civilization,
and so is the extensive and lucrative commerce that is
carried on with every country in the known world; but
I blush for the corrupt tastes of my countrymen, when
I see silk dresses purchased with an equal weight of
gold, and immense sums of money squandered in the
Asiatic merchants' shops, for pearls, and jewels, and
aromatics, and hangings, and carpets from Tyre and
Babylon, and the distant cities of Persia.  The strongest
mark of the decline of Roman manners is, I think, the
ostentatious display which every citizen now makes of a
multitude of household slaves.  In one palace that I have
visited with my uncle, no less than four hundred are to
be found; and the wealth of a Roman is estimated by the
number of slaves that he possesses.  That is a melancholy
species of wealth which consists in the persons of our
fellow-creatures!  Camillas says that they were born to
serve the Romans; but I cannot believe that the great
and merciful Creator designed one race of men to be subject
to the cruelty and caprice of another, or that victory
in war can entitle the conquerors to treat the vanquished
like beasts of burden.  A sad procession of captive Jews
arrived here a few days ago, sent by Vespasian from
one of the conquered cities of Galilee, and they were led
to the public market and sold as slaves.  Their manly
and heroic countenances filled me with pity and with
grief, and I was weak enough&mdash;as Camillus would have
called it&mdash;to weep at the degradation of so many noble
human beings; and particularly when I reflected that
they were Naomi's fellow-countrymen, and that her own
father and brother, yes, and even she herself, might one
day be exposed to the same indignity and misery.  Oh
may the Lord avert so deep a calamity, and give the
Jews a heart to see their danger and imprudence, and to
retrace their steps, ere themselves and all most dear to
them are plunged in ruin and in slavery!  Farewell, my
dear Claudia.  Commend me with great affection and
respect to Naomi, and greet her parents and her brother
as my oldest friends.  The blessing of heaven attend you
all; and may God listen to the prayers that are daily
offered up for you by your brother
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MARCELLUS."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This long letter from her beloved brother gave Claudia
the greatest pleasure; and though she expressed much
surprise at the entire change in his sentiments on
religion, and the deep importance which he now seemed to
attach to that subject, yet the change did not appear to
give her any dissatisfaction, and from that time she
listened with attention and complacency to all the
arguments of Naomi, and even obeyed her brother's injunction
to peruse the inspired writings of Moses and the prophets,
of which her friend possessed a beautiful copy.  The
intelligence conveyed in the letter of Marcellus was to
Naomi a source of unmixed joy and gratitude.  That he
who had so long possessed her esteem and affection should
have forsaken the sin and folly of idolatry, and have
learned to worship that one Supreme Being who was the
object of her entire devotion, filled her with delight; and
she felt that her attachment to him, against which she
had so long struggled, was now no longer guilty.  But
a great change had taken place in her own opinions and
feelings since her first interview with Mary on the Mount
of Olives.  All that she had heard from that aged
disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ had sunk deep into her
heart, and God had caused the word of truth spoken by
his feeble servant to take root in the soul of the young
Jewess.  She could not banish the subject from her
thoughts; and the natural energy and determination of
her character led her to risk everything, in order to
obtain information on a point which she felt to be one of
eternal consequence.
</p>

<p>
She had therefore used all her influence with the
kind-hearted, indulgent old Deborah; and had already induced
her to accompany her more than once to the house of her
Christian friend, and to leave her there to enjoy, for as
long a time as it was safe to do so, the conversation that
was at once so interesting and so delightful.  Deborah
was not informed that Mary was one of the detested sect
of the Nazarenes, or even Naomi would have failed to
persuade her to assist in these stolen interviews; but she
knew that her religion differed from that of her young
friend, and therefore she believed that she was of a
different sect of Jews to that of which Zadok and his
family were distinguished members, and that consequently
Naomi's friendship for her would be disapproved
of by her father; but she thought no great harm could
come from these meetings, and promised that she would
keep them secret.
</p>

<p>
Nothing would ever have induced the open-hearted
affectionate Naomi to conceal any of her actions from her
parents, but the certainty that, in this case, their
knowledge of her object, and the change that was rapidly
being effected in her sentiments, would only cause them
profound grief and excite their severe displeasure,
without in any way banishing from her mind the ardent
desire and resolution to become acquainted with the
doctrines of Christianity.  She felt that her soul was at
stake; and if all she heard from Mary was true, it was
her duty even to forsake her father and mother, rather
than deny and abandon that faith which was able to
make her wise unto salvation.  She could not conceal
from herself that already she was almost persuaded to
be a Christian; and the blessed hopes of life and
immortality that were opened to her mind as the Gospel of
Jesus Christ was gradually mads known to her, brought
with them a satisfaction and joy such as she had never
felt before, and such as she would not have resigned for
any earthly consideration.
</p>

<p>
"Would Marcellus ever believe in the crucified Jesus
of Nazareth?" was a thought that crossed her mind with
force, while she rejoiced in the declaration which she had
just heard in his letter to Claudia, of his being no longer
an idolater;&mdash;"otherwise should we not be still divided
by our faith, even as we have ever been?"&mdash;and her
first act on finding herself alone, was to implore that the
same grace that had already partially dispelled the
blindness and unbelief of her own heart, might be
granted to Marcellus, and lead him to a like faith.
"When we meet," said she to herself, "I will repeat to
him all that Mary has told me;&mdash;never will one word
of her discourse pass from my memory;&mdash;or, if possible,
I will lead him to her dwelling, and he shall hear the
words of truth and wonder from her own lips.  He
has proved that his soul is open to conviction, by so
quickly receiving the belief in one Almighty God; and
doubtless he will as candidly and freely listen to the
story of Jesus of Nazareth, and then surely he will
see, and believe, and adore, as I feel myself constrained
to do."
</p>

<p>
Had Naomi known all that Marcellus had not ventured
to declare in his letter, how happy and how thankful
would she have been!&mdash;for he had already advanced
beyond herself in religious light and knowledge, and was
a sincere, devoted, and enlightened Christian.  The
teacher to whom he owed his conversion was no other
than Clement of Rome, the fellow-worker with St. Paul
and, who, after having laboured in the church at
Philippi, had removed to the capital, where in after times he
succeeded to the bishopric, and lived until the third year
of the reign of the Emperor Trajan.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
</h3>

<p>
The letter of Rufus conveyed the intelligence of
Josephus's preservation, and his captivity in the Roman
camp, and Zadok hastened to communicate it to the
chief men of the city.  The news spread rapidly through
Jerusalem, and as rapidly the sorrow that had been felt
and shown on account of his supposed death was changed
into the fiercest indignation at his thus consenting to
survive his heroic countrymen.  Some called him a
dastardly coward, who had feared to meet an honourable
death, while others execrated his name as a traitor; and
a fierce desire to wreak their vengeance on the apostate
was now added to the other motives for resistance to the
Romans.  They longed to see Vespasian's standards
approach their walls, in the full conviction that no power
would resist the fury of their sally on the foe, and that
all their calamities and reverses would be obliterated in
the blood of their enemies.
</p>

<p>
But Vespasian did not yet give them the opportunity
which they so madly desired.  What were his motives
for not pursuing his victorious way to Jerusalem at that
time is uncertain; but so it was, that he turned aside and
left the rebels in the capital to exercise their fury on
themselves, and thus to weaken their own powers.  The
Roman general visited Agrippa at Cæsarea, on the
sea-coast, and then passed to Cæsarea Philippi in the north
of Galilee, where he allowed his army to rest and refresh
themselves for twenty days.
</p>

<p>
He then proceeded to quell the symptoms of
insurrection which had been displayed in Tiberias and Tarichea,
two cities on the Lake of Genesareth that belonged to
King Agrippa, but seemed little disposed to unite with
him in his attachment to the Roman party.  Tiberias
soon surrendered, but a body of insurgents left the city,
and took refuge in Tarichea, which had been carefully
fortified by Josephus.  The Roman army pitched their
camp beneath the walls, and commenced their preparations
for a siege; and while their works were advancing,
a reinforcement of young recruits arrived from Rome,
and joined the legions already assembled.  Among these
recruits was Marcellus, who was received with the
warmest affection by his father, and through his interest
was soon enrolled among the troops under the special
command of Titus.  Before he was allowed to take his
place among his future comrades, an oath was administered
to him, according to the military custom of the
Romans, with every circumstance of solemnity.  He
was required to swear that he would never desert his
standard, that he would submit his own will to the commands
of his leaders, and that he would sacrifice his life
for the safety of the emperor or the empire.  This
ceremony being performed, his arms were presented to him,
and he became one of the redoubted band of cavalry so
nobly led by the gallant Titus.  The arms of attack and
defence of the cavalry consisted of a coat of mail, and
light boots and helmet; an oblong shield was fastened
on the left arm, while the right hand carried a long
javelin, and a sharp broadsword hung from the girdle.
The foot soldiers were very differently accoutred, having
an open helmet with a lofty crest, a breastplate of iron,
and greaves of the same metal on their legs.  A shield
or buckler, four feet long and two feet and a-half wide,
was carried on the left arm, and was capable of covering
the whole person, when the troops knelt to receive the
charge of their enemies.  It was composed of a frame of
light wood, on which was stretched a bull's-hide, and
strengthened with plates of brass.  Their offensive arms
were powerful and various, consisting of a light spear for
thrusting, and also pilium, or ponderous javelin, six feet
long, and terminating in a steel point of the length of
eighteen inches.  This was thrown from a distance of
ten or twelve yards; and such were its force and weight
when cast by the practised hand of a veteran legionary,
that neither shield nor corslet could resist it.  After the
pilium had been thrown, the soldier drew his short,
double-edged sword, and rushed forward to the closer
and yet more deadly conflict that was carried on hand to
hand.
</p>

<p>
For a few days the operations of the besieging army
continued undisturbed, and Marcellus was not called to
prove his own courage and discipline, or the temper of
his polished and unsullied arms.  He therefore employed
this brief period of leisure in rambling along the shores
of the beautiful lake, as far as he could do so with
safety.  It was a lovely spot, and even to a common
observer could not fail to be full of interest.  The blue
waters stretched before him, calm and transparent
beneath the warm beams of an eastern sun, and the shores
were crowded with rich and populous towns, whose
terraced roofs and lofty towers were seen rising above
the luxuriant groves and orchards that clothed the
whole of that fertile district.  The graceful palm, the
dark olive, and the spreading fig-tree fringed the very
margin of the lake, and were reflected on its smooth
surface as on a mirror; while every port was animated
with vessels preparing to assist the Taricheans in the
defence of their city, or in case of a defeat to carry
them off to the other side of the lake.  A great part
of the town was washed by the waters, and thus
protected from the assault of the Romans, and a strong
wall was carried round on every other side.  Close to
this wall the camp of Vespasian was pitched, and the
white tents and glittering banners glanced gaily in the
sunshine.  Marcellus wandered in the shade of a grove
of palms, and looked with admiration and emotion on
the scene before him; but it was not the natural beauty
of the landscape which chiefly excited his feelings, nor
was it the animating view of military preparations or
the thoughts of military glory that now filled the heart
of the young soldier.  No, his soul was absorbed in
thoughts of days gone by, and his imagination pictured
to him the scenes that had once been witnessed on the
shores of that now tranquil lake.  His fancy once again
peopled the grove in which he stood with a multitude
of Galilean peasants and rude fishermen, with men,
women, and children, all hushed in silence, and listening
with deep attention to the words of one individual who
stood in the midst of them, and on whom every eye
was turned.  No rays of visible glory shone round the
head of the speaker&mdash;no heavenly light illuminated his
features&mdash;his form was as that of other men; and yet,
oh how different!  There was a calm majesty in his
person, and an expression of godlike mercy and
compassion in his mild and dignified countenance, that
separated him immeasurably from all the human beings
that surrounded him.  And from his lips proceeded such
gracious, such piercing words of instruction, of reproof,
of love, and of pity, that Marcellus awoke from his deep
reverie, exclaiming, "Truly never man spoke like this
man!  O blessed Jesus! would that I had seen thy day
on earth, and had lived a humble fisherman on these
shores, that I might have heard thy voice, and followed
thy steps, and ministered to thee and died with thee!"
</p>

<p>
So thought and so felt the ardent young convert; and
so have thought and felt many a sincere Christian,
while recalling to his mind the days when his Saviour
walked upon the earth, and marvelling at the unbelief
and hardness of heart, and faithless conduct of those
who beheld his miracles and heard his instructions;
yes, even of those chosen few who were privileged to
be his followers and his friends.  But "let him that
thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall."  Had we
been brought up in the errors and prejudices of the
Jews in those days, we too might have rejected and
disbelieved the Messiah in his poverty and humility;
and let us beware that with all the light of the Gospel,
and all the advantages of a Christian education, we do
not practically reject the Saviour, and in our lives deny
him.  Let us ask of him strength to cleave to him
through all temptations and all trials, and faith to believe
in him, though as yet we see not his face; remembering
his own words of encouragement, "Blessed are they
who have not seen, and yet have believed."
</p>

<p>
Marcellus lingered long in the shady grove.  Before
he left Rome he had been presented by his beloved
teacher, Clement, with a small copy of the Gospel of
St. Matthew; and this treasure he always carried about
him, and eagerly sought every opportunity of studying
it, when he could do so unobserved.  He now drew it
forth, and unrolled the long and narrow strip of
parchment on which it was inscribed.  It was written in
Hebrew, but his long residence in Jerusalem, and his
constant intercourse with the family of Zadok, had
made him familiar with that language, and he read with
interest and delight until the shades of evening warned
him to return to his father's tent.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," thought he, "if Naomi and Claudia were but
with me, here in the scene of the miracles and the
preaching of Him whom now they despise, how would
I read to them the words of his own mouth, and how
would I endeavour to repeat to them all that I heard from
my venerable friend at Rome, and to touch their hearts
and convince their minds with the narratives, the
arguments, and the entreaties that he employed to remove
the thick cloud of ignorance and prejudice in which I
was enveloped, and to bless me with the light of the
Gospel of Christ!  Naomi at least worships the one
Almighty and true God, though in error and in darkness;
but my poor Claudia, she, alas! is yet in idolatry,
May the Lord Jehovah give power and strength to the
words of her friend, and bring her to the knowledge of
Himself, and so prepare her to receive the truths of
Christianity!  And my father, too, shall he live and die
in his idolatry?  God forbid!  Alas, alas, my dear kind
mother is gone beyond the reach of human teaching.
She is in that world where no doubts or uncertainties
remain; and though she died in ignorance and unbelief,
yet surely it was only because the truth was never revealed
to her.  Her heart was pious and humble; she sought
for God, and found him not, because she was surrounded
with the gross darkness of idolatry; and surely He who
died for all hath wiped away her sins and redeemed her
soul, although she knew Him not."
</p>

<p>
Marcellus had fondly loved his mother, and her death
had been embittered to him by the reflection that she
died a heathen; and now he sought to assuage his grief
by dwelling on the mercy of his God and Saviour, and
trusting that as so "little had been given to her, much
would not be required."  This is a hope which we have
reason confidently to indulge; for we are taught that
the mercy of the Lord is infinite towards those who act
up to the light that is given to them, and thus "having
no law, are a law unto themselves."
</p>

<p>
Full of such reflections, Marcellus entered the camp,
and passed along the lines of tents that formed broad
and straight streets, thickly peopled with soldiers and
the numerous followers of the army.  In his father's
tent he found Javan, whom he had not seen since his
arrival at Tarichea.  Though they had lived so much
together in the days of their childhood and early youth,
the great dissimilarity in their dispositions had prevented
them from forming any friendship; and Marcellus could
not but recall the numerous instances of unkind and
arbitrary conduct that had so warmly roused his
indignation against Javan in former days, and produced sharp
altercation between them.  But now he met him as a
prisoner, humbled, though unchanged, and his newly
acquired Christian principles taught him to forgive his
enemy, and to comfort him in his distress.  And then
he was the brother of Naomi, though most unworthy to
be so nearly connected to one so amiable, and generous,
and lovely; and therefore the young Roman met him
with an open kindness of manner that somewhat
surprised the crafty and suspicious Javan.
</p>

<p>
It was however his interest to conciliate Marcellus,
and he received him with an appearance of cordiality,
and entered with him and Rufus into a long and
interesting conversation upon their friends in Jerusalem,
and the prospects of the capital being soon subjected to
a siege, unless the rulers consented to a submission.
Captivity had not subdued the spirit of Javan, and all
his fierceness broke forth at such a suggestion.  Death
in its worst form, would, he declared, be far preferable
to such a degradation; but while he made the assertion,
his hearers remembered how he and his general had so
lately consented to purchase their lives at the expense of
their liberties, and Rufus could not quite conceal the
smile that curled his lip while he listened to such bold
professions.  Javan saw and understood the smile, and
his heart was filled with rage; and he inwardly vowed
to be revenged when once more at liberty, and in a
situation to encounter his benefactor with arms in his
hand.
</p>

<p>
Marcellus saw but little of him for some time after
this meeting, for his time and attention were soon
occupied by the active proceedings of the siege.  A sudden
and vigorous sally was made by the fugitive Tiberians
who had taken refuge in the city, upon a point where
the military works were rapidly advancing; they
dispersed the workmen and destroyed their labours; and
when the troops advanced in strong array against them,
they fled back and escaped without any loss of life,
A large party of them took refuge in the vessels that
lay in their port, being unable to reach the gate from
whence they had come forth; and then they pushed
off into the lake, and cast anchor in a regular line,
within reach of the missiles of their enemies, and
commenced a battle, which terminated without any decisive
effect.
</p>

<p>
The next day Marcellus was summoned to go forth
with six hundred of his comrades to disperse a large
body of Galileans, who were assembled in a plain before
the city.  When Titus, who commanded this troop of
horse, arrived within sight of the insurgents, he
perceived that their numbers were so immense, that he
thought it necessary to demand further succours, and
sent a messenger to his father for that purpose; but
before the reinforcement could reach him, he resolved
to charge the enemy.  He made a short and spirited
address to his men, and exhorted them not to shrink
from encountering the multitude before them, but to
advance boldly and secure the victory before their
fellow-soldiers arrived to share the glory.  He then placed
himself at their head and prepared to lead them on,
when four hundred horse appeared on the field, sent by
Vespasian to strengthen his forces.  His men were
rather disposed to be angry than to rejoice at this arrival,
so eager were they to uphold their character for bravery
by meeting the enemy unsupported.  Titus led the
attack, and at first met with a firm resistance; but the
Jews could not stand against the long spears of the cavalry,
and overpowered by the weight of the horses and the
force of the charge, they fled in confusion towards
the city.  The cavalry endeavoured to cut off their
retreat, and the havoc which they made among the
fugitives was dreadful, though numbers of them escaped
and rushed in at the gates.
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants saw that there was no hope of their
resisting the foe, and desirous of preserving their lives
and property, they proposed a surrender of the town;
but the Tiberians and other strangers steadily refused to
comply with this desire.  The dissension became loud
and tumultuous, and Titus hearing the noise and
confusion within the walls, cried out to his men to seize
the opportunity of making a vigorous attack, while the
attention of the besieged was distracted by civil discord.
He leaped upon his horse, and dashing into the lake,
entered the city where it was undefended by the strong
wall that enclosed it on all other sides.  Numbers of his
troops followed him; and such was the consternation of
the besieged at this sudden and unexpected entrance, that
they remained as if stupified, and attempted no resistance.
The insurgents and many others sought to save themselves
by rushing to the lake, but they met the Romans
pouring into the city, and were slain before they could
regain the streets.
</p>

<p>
When Titus ascertained that the chiefs of the rebel
party were slain, he commanded his soldiers to cease
from carnage; but he sent to inform his father that
numbers of the inhabitants had escaped in boats, and
had pushed out to sea beyond the reach of the archers.
Vespasian immediately had several vessels prepared, and
embarked a detachment of troops to pursue the fugitives
to the middle of the lake.  The light boats of the poor
Galileans could offer no resistance to the Roman vessels,
and they could only row swiftly round them, and
endeavour to annoy the legionaries by throwing stones and
darts among them, which merely served to irritate their
pursuers.  The shores were lined with hostile troops; and
if they attempted to take refuge in some creek or rocky
inlet, they were met by fierce enemies, or followed by
the Roman barks, and pierced by their long spears, as
they stood above them on their lofty decks.  Many of
the boats were crushed by the larger vessels, and when
the drowning crew rose above the water, they were
transfixed by the arrows and lances of their infuriated
foes.  The surface of the lake, that so lately sparkled in
peaceful beauty, was broken with forms of death and
struggles of agony; its blue waters were tinged with
blood, and for several days a corrupt vapour rose over
its whole extent, bearing fearful witness to the multitude
of slaughtered human beings that were concealed
beneath.  The verdant shores were scattered over with
disfigured and unburied corpses, swollen and decaying
beneath the burning sun; and the Romans themselves
loathed to look upon the dreadful work of their own
hands.  Marcellus was not yet inured to scenes of cruelty
and blood; and his heart sickened when he beheld
the smiling, and in his eyes sacred, shores of the Galilean
sea thus polluted with the remains of such ruthless
barbarity.
</p>

<p>
For the cruelty of this massacre Vespasian may not
be charged; but a blot remains upon his name for one
action which succeeded it, and never can it be effaced
by his glory in after days.  Numbers of strangers had
been taken captive by the Romans at the conquest of
Tarichea, and as they were looked upon as the most
determined rebels, they were kept distinct from the
other prisoners.  A tribunal was erected in the city,
and the general proceeded to pass judgment on these
offenders against the majesty of Rome.  Instigated by
some of his officers, he resolved on putting all these
unfortunate strangers to death, lest, having no homes,
they should wander through the country exciting riot
and rebellion.  But he feared to execute his barbarous
decree in the streets of Tarichea, nor did he choose
to expose to the whole city his cruel violation of the
promise that had been given to these unfortunate men
when they surrendered.  He therefore ordered them to
retire from the city, but only by the way that led to
Tiberias.  Hitherto the word of the Romans had been
looked upon as inviolable, and the wretched wanderers
proceeded forth by the route which was commanded
them.  But they found the road guarded and blockaded
on every side, and they could not proceed beyond the
suburbs.  Vespasian himself pursued them into the
Stadium, and there twelve hundred of the aged and
helpless were slain in cold blood; and six thousand, who
were considered most fit for work, were reserved to be
sent to Nero, and to be employed in labouring at some
of his wild schemes; while thirty thousand were sold
as slaves, besides a number that were presented to
Agrippa.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless multitudes of these unhappy creatures were
ruffians and vagabonds, whose object was to excite war
and commotion in order that they might escape the due
punishment of their crimes; but no considerations of
this nature can palliate the cruelty and falsehood of
Vespasian.
</p>

<p>
Many of the Galilean towns laid down their arms
and opened their gates to the Romans, dismayed at
the fearful example that had been set before them; and
only Gamala, Gischala, and Itabyrium, with a few smaller
towns, continued to hold out a defiance.  Gamala was
even considered a stronger fortress than Jotapata; and
proud of its situation, the inhabitants refused to submit
to the conqueror.  But after a long and terrible siege
it fell, on the 23rd of September, A.D. 67, and every
inhabitant was slain, except two sisters of Philip,
Agrippa's general; and they contrived to hide
themselves from the cruel visitors.  We will not any longer
dwell on the horrible scenes of carnage that took place.
To escape the swords of the Romans, many hundreds
of men threw their wives and children down the
precipices, and then dashed after them to swift and certain
destruction.
</p>

<p>
Itabyrium had fallen, and Gischala, Jamnia, and
Azotus, alone remained in arms.  Terrified by the fate
of the neighbouring towns, the inhabitants would have
submitted, but a strong faction within the walls, headed
by John the son of Levi (better known as John of
Gischala), prevented them from capitulating; and Titus
was sent against the city at the head of a thousand horse.
He saw that he might easily take it by assault, but he
was weary of bloodshed, and probably also was aware of
the peaceful disposition of the inhabitants, and he offered
them terms if they would surrender.  The wily John
prevented the people from approaching the walls, which
were manned by his own party, and he himself replied
to the message of Titus.  He affected great moderation
and perfect acquiescence to the proposed terms; but
stated that the day being the sabbath, the Jews could
not proceed to comply with them without violating their
most sacred laws; and therefore he begged for a delay.
Titus complied with this apparently reasonable request,
and even withdrew his troops to the town of Cydoessa,
at a little distance.
</p>

<p>
John perceived that his artifice had succeeded; and at
midnight he stole out of the city with all his band of
armed followers, and a multitude of others, with their
families and property, who had resolved on flying to
Jerusalem.  But soon the strength of the women and
children began to fail, and they could follow no longer.
The men abandoned them, and proceeded rapidly, leaving
those who should have been their first care to perish
unheeded and alone.  The hard-hearted John urged his
men to greater speed; and the miserable women sat
down with their little ones to die in darkness and despair,
while they listened to the departing footsteps of their
cruel husbands and fathers, as the sounds died away in
the increasing distance.
</p>

<p>
Titus appeared at the gates of the city the following
day, to claim the performance of the terms that had
been agreed upon; and the inhabitants who remained
within the walls gladly threw them open, and delivered
themselves up with their families into the hands of the
conquerors.  When he learned the treachery of John,
he immediately sent a troop of horse to overtake him,
but he had escaped beyond their reach, and they returned
to Gischala, bringing with them three thousand women
and children, and having slain six thousand of the weary
fugitives who had slackened their pace, and were separated
from their selfish leader and his robber band.  The
conduct of Titus was marked with clemency and
moderation towards the captured city: he merely threw down
a portion of the wall, and left a garrison in the place to
keep possession.  Shortly after the surrender of Gischala,
Jamnia and Azotus also followed its example, and
received Roman garrisons; when the season being
advanced, Vespasian closed the campaign, and retired to
Cæsarea with his army.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
</h3>

<p>
The subjugation of Galilee had hitherto employed the
whole of Vespasian's army; and such had been the
courage and obstinacy displayed by the Jews, that it had
cost the Romans much labour and pains to subdue the
rebellious province.  The leaders of the nation in Jerusalem
had sent no forces to assist their Galilean brethren,
nor had they used any other means for the relief of the
besieged places.  All their time and all their strength
were wasted in violent civil dissensions, and furious
struggles for power and authority in the metropolis.
Perhaps also they hoped that the patience of the Romans
would be exhausted, by the long continuance of the war
in Galilee, and by the time and labour that were required
to reduce one rebellious town after another; and that
they would at length depart, and leave Jerusalem to its
assumed independence.  But far better would it have
been if they had employed the time that was allowed
them in preparing for the part which they ultimately had
to perform; and if instead of admitting John of Gischala
and his unprincipled followers into the city, they had
sought to compose the dissensions that already existed,
and to unite under one chief, for the general protection
and safety.
</p>

<p>
But the fame of John had reached their ears, and the
fact that he had been the rival and the enemy of the now
despised Josephus, only raised him in the estimation of
the people.  As soon as it was known that he was
approaching the city, multitudes flocked out to meet and
welcome him.  The exhausted and breathless condition
of the men and their horses too plainly told that they had
travelled far and fast; but the deceitful John assured the
inquiring populace that they had not fled from necessity
or fear, but that they were unwilling to spend their
strength and courage in the cause of meaner towns, and
had come to shed their blood in the defence of the
capital.  This reply, however, did not satisfy all who
heard it; and, from the evident confusion and
discomfiture of the fugitives, and the dreadful details of
massacre and ruin which they received from some of
the men, they felt convinced that they had fled to save
their lives from the Roman vengeance, and foreboded the
fate that probably awaited themselves.  John was a man
of subtle and insinuating manner, and he employed his
eloquence and his artifice successfully in persuading the
people of Jerusalem that the Roman power was already
so broken, and their troops so wearied and dispirited,
that they would never venture to enter on the siege of
such a formidable place as their beloved city.
</p>

<p>
The young and daring listened and applauded with
loud shouts of approbation, but the old men doubted and
feared for the future.  The party of John was increased
by numbers of fresh adherents, and the city became more
than ever the scene of discord and violence.  One faction
was for war, another for peace; and the conflicting
opinions distracted the public councils, and divided even
private families into fierce and opposing parties.  Every
individual who had power or wealth sufficient, gathered
around himself a band of adherents; and these lawless
companies overspread the neighbouring country, insulting,
robbing, and murdering the unoffending peasantry,
who refused to join them in their crimes and violence.
Multitudes of the inhabitants of the villages, believing
that they could have nothing worse to fear from the
Romans than what they suffered from their own countrymen,
fled to the garrison towns; but the Romans either
rejoiced in the civil discord and mutual destruction, or
considered that they had no concern in their quarrels,
and they afforded the sufferers but little protection.
</p>

<p>
At length a powerful and numerous body of these
marauders contrived to get into Jerusalem, and establish
themselves permanently in the Holy City.  They were
not expelled or opposed; for the warlike party hoped by
the accession of these bold and daring men, to gain
strength for the defence of the metropolis.  But they only
added to the misery and tumult that already reigned
within the walls; and with the multitude of persons who
flocked from the neighbouring towns and villages, to take
refuge in Jerusalem, they greatly hastened the consumption
of provisions, which ought to have been reserved for
a time of need, and famine began to be felt among other
evils and woes.
</p>

<p>
The wise and excellent Zadok, with a few of his friends
who were not actuated by avarice, ambition, or revenge,
strove to stem the torrent of sedition and violence, and
preserve order and decorum among the populace.  But
what could the efforts of a few individuals, however
well-directed, effect against the influence of bribery, and
passion, and intemperance, and licensed crime?  Beyond
their own families and immediate dependents, their
counsels and warnings were unheeded and despised: and
robberies, burglaries, and assassinations took place in the
open day in the streets of Jerusalem.  The robbers seized
on Antipas, a man of royal blood, who had the charge of
the public treasures, and cast him into prison.  The next
victims were Saphias and Levias, two members of the
Herodian family, and many others of noble rank shared
the same fate.
</p>

<p>
The people saw and feared; but so long as they were
themselves unmolested, they took no measures to stay the
growing evils.  Emboldened by their present impunity,
the ruffians proceeded to greater atrocities, and unwilling
either to release their prisoners, or to keep them any
longer captive, they sent ten of their party with drawn
swords into the prison, who speedily massacred the
unfortunate captives.  At length they dared to invade the
sacred temple, and insult the majesty of Heaven with
their impieties: the very holy of holies was entered and
polluted by the feet of the murderers; and then the
indignation of the populace broke forth.  Ananus, the
eldest of the chief priests, was the acknowledged leader
of the party opposed to the robbers.  He was a man of
wisdom and moderation, but he now incited the people
to resistance; and the band of Zealots fled to the temple,
which they made their head-quarters, and turned into a
garrison.  That holy and beautiful house of God, the
object of the fondest veneration and pride to all the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, was now the scene of warlike
preparation and boisterous intemperance; and instead of
hymns of prayer and praise, and the harmony of musical
instruments, its marble and gilded walls re-echoed with the
shouts and songs of the drunkards, or the clash of arms.
</p>

<p>
The Zealots even presumed to elect a high-priest by
lot, and proclaimed the deposition of Matthias, who had
a rightful claim to that dignity.  The people rose
unanimously at this sacrilegious act; and even those of the
priests who had hitherto sought to preserve peace, now
exhorted them to throw off the yoke of the Zealots.
Zadok joined with Ananus and Joseph, and others, and
both in public and private harangued the infuriated
populace.
</p>

<p>
An assembly was convened, and Ananus, in a long and
eloquent speech, pointed out to his hearers the state of
degradation to which they had allowed themselves to be
reduced, far more disgraceful than if they had submitted
to the power of the Romans; and as he spoke, he turned
his tearful eyes towards the violated temple, and
reproached the people with abandoning it into the hands of
robbers.  He was listened to with deep attention, and at
the close of his harangue the crowd around him demanded
to be led instantly to the rescue of the temple.  The spies
of the Zealot party who were among the multitude, gave
them instant intelligence of the feeling which was excited
against them, and while Ananus and Zadok were
ordering their forces, a band of these robbers fell upon
them.  The battle raged with fury; numbers were slain
on both sides, and their bodies carried off.  Those of the
Zealots who fell were borne back to the temple, and the
polished marble pavement was stained and polluted with
their blood.  The populace pressed on, and drove the
Zealots back into the temple, following them within the
sacred walls with furious cries.  The robbers passed the
outer court, and secured the gates of the next enclosure
against their pursuers; and Ananus would not allow his
followers to press their advantage, and assault the gates,
for he feared to commit violence in so holy a spot, or to
take his people into that court which was yet polluted
with slaughter and crime.  He therefore retired, leaving
six thousand men in the cloisters, to keep guard and
watch the motions of the robbers.
</p>

<p>
The subtle John of Gischala had hitherto professed to
support the cause of Ananus, but all the while he
maintained a correspondence with the adverse party; and to
prevent his double dealing from being suspected, he made
such vehement protestations of fidelity to Ananus, and so
readily took an oath of obedience and devotion, that the
priests and their party were entirely deceived, and
admitted him into their most secret councils, and even
deputed him to go to the temple, and endeavour to bring
their enemies to terms.
</p>

<p>
The traitor undertook the mission; but no sooner was
he within the temple walls, than he threw off the mask,
and addressed the robber crew as if he had taken an oath
to support them, and not to oppose them.  He told them
that he had incurred serious dangers in the endeavour to
befriend them; that schemes were now being concerted
for delivering the city up to the Romans: and that their
destruction was inevitable, as Ananus had resolved to get
into the temple, either under the pretence of performing
worship, or else by main force; and he warned them that
if they did not obtain some succour speedily, they would
be at the mercy of the enraged populace.  The leaders of
the Zealots were Eleazer, the old enemy of Ananus, and
Zacharias, the son of Phalea.  They readily believed that
vengeance would be taken on them by the opposing party;
and instantly adopting the crafty suggestions of John,
they despatched swift messengers to the Idumeans, to
demand their assistance.
</p>

<p>
These fierce and uncivilized people were incorporated
with the Jews as one nation; but they retained the love
of adventure which belonged to their Arab blood, and the
application of the Zealots was received with wild cries of
joy.  They hastily assembled, and formed themselves
into a regular army of twenty thousand men, under the
command of James and John the sons of Lofas, Simon
the son of Cathlas, and Phineas the son of Clusothas,
This numerous and powerful body advanced immediately
towards Jerusalem, proclaiming that they were marching
to the relief of the capital.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly they appeared beneath the walls and
demanded admittance.  The gates were closed, and Jesus,
one of the chief priests, was deputed by Ananus to
expostulate with them.  He proposed to them either to
join with the inhabitants in punishing those who caused
the present tumult, or to enter without arms and mediate
between the contending parties; or else to depart again
to their own homes, and leave Jerusalem to finish its own
internal war.  All these propositions were rudely refused
by the Idumeans; and Simon the son of Cathlas, replied,
that they came to protect the patriotic party against those
who wished to sell them to the Romans, and they were
resolved to accomplish this design.  His words were
received with loud shouts by the Idumeans, and Jesus
returned to Ananus, discouraged and apprehensive.
</p>

<p>
Simon encamped before the gates, and thus the party
of Ananus found themselves besieged by two separate
forces.  The Zealots could not communicate with their
new allies, for they were closely shut up in the temple;
and the Idumeans could gain no access to them.  Their
camp was inconvenient, and in an exposed situation; and
many of them repented of their hasty march for as night
drew on a fearful tempest gathered over the city, and
broke with such violence as to strike terror into all who
heard it; and every heart trembled in the conviction
that it was a dreadful omen of coming destruction and
woe.  The rain fell in torrents, and was accompanied by
terrific thunder and lightning, while the earth shook
with the frequent vibrations of an earthquake.  The
Idumeans were exposed to the violence of the storm,
with but little shelter, except their own broad shields,
which they locked together over their heads, and thus
obtained some protection from the heavy rain; while the
Zealots looked forth from their elevated situation in the
temple, anxious for the fate of their new allies, and
eagerly sought some opportunity of rendering them
assistance.  Some of the most daring among them
proposed to sally forth amid the darkness and tumult of the
storm, force their way to the gates, and open them to
admit their friends; trusting by the suddenness and fury
of their assault, to overpower and scatter the guards who
were placed in the outer court.  But the more prudent
objected strongly to this desperate measure, as they knew
that the guards were more numerous than their own
party, and also that the city walls and gates were closely
watched, to prevent a surprise from the Idumeans.  It
was likewise the nightly custom of Ananus to pass up
and down continually, and see that the sentinels were all
at their posts, and he was now expected every moment.
</p>

<p>
On this one dreadful night, this necessary precaution
was omitted.  Perhaps Ananus trusted to the strength
of the guard, which had been doubled since the arrival
of the Idumeans; or perhaps from the violence of the
tempest, he felt assured that no attack would be attempted
at that time.  Whatever were his motives, assuredly
they were overruled by an all-directing Providence, and
made instrumental in bringing about the destruction and
massacre which were permitted that night for the
chastisement of a rebellious people.  The darkness was
profound; the storm raged fearfully; and many of the
guard stole away for rest and shelter.  This negligence
was discovered by the watchful Zealots; and seizing on
the sacred instruments of the temple, they proceeded to
wrench off the hinges of one of the gates, and thus to
open to themselves a way into the streets.  The whistling
and roaring of the wind, and the loud claps of thunder,
drowned the noise of their operations, and a strong party
of them reached the walls of the city undiscovered.  They
immediately applied their saws and crowbars to the gate,
near which the Idumeans were encamped, and quickly
tore it open.
</p>

<p>
The Idumeans at first suspected that this was some
artifice of Ananus, to draw them on to destruction and
they retreated in terror; but soon the Zealots approached,
and reassured them, offering to conduct them to victory
and revenge; and had they instantly made an attack on
the city, nothing could have prevented a fearful and
general slaughter.  But their guides persuaded them
first to hasten to the temple, and rescue the remainder
of their party ere the guard should be aroused; for if
those who watched the gates were once secured, and the
whole band of Zealots released, they were assured that
the conquest of the city would soon be accomplished
amid the darkness and confusion of night.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Zealots in the temple were anxiously
awaiting the result of their enterprise; and when they
found that the Idumeans were entering the sacred
enclosure, they boldly came forth and joined them, and
then altogether falling on the guard, many of whom were
buried in a profound sleep, they commenced a fearful
slaughter.  The guard at first gathered themselves
together, and made head against their assailants; but when
they found that the Idumeans were among their foes,
they were convinced that the city was betrayed, and the
greater part of them threw down their arms in a sudden
panic.  A few of the youngest and most courageous still
maintained the conflict, and supported the attack of the
Idumeans, while some of the older men escaped, and fled
shrieking down the streets, awaking and alarming the
slumbering inhabitants with an announcement of the
dreadful calamity.  They were answered by the screams
and cries of women and children, sounding shrilly
through the storm; while the wild shouts of the
Idumeans and the Zealots came fearfully from the heights
of Mount Moriah, and murky clouds gave forth their
awful flashes and pealing thunders.  No mercy was
shown by the Idumeans to any of the guard who fell
into their hands.  In vain they appealed to the sanctity
of the holy temple for protection; even its most sacred
precincts were deluged with blood; and in despair many
of the terrified men threw themselves headlong from the
lofty rock on which the temple stood, and were dashed
to pieces in the deep abyss below.

<br>
DEATH OF ANANUS.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the outer court was strewed with the
dead and dying; and when daylight broke on this awful
scene of carnage, eight thousand five hundred bodies were
found heaped on this one spot.
</p>

<p>
But the pure light of day did not put an end to the
deeds of darkness and of blood that disgraced it.  The
ruffian band broke into the city, slaying and pillaging on
every side.  Ananus&mdash;the wise, the patriotic Ananus,
on whom rested the hopes of all the rational and
well-disposed inhabitants&mdash;and Jesus the son of Gamala, were
seized and put to death, and their bodies trampled under
the feet of their murderers, who reproached them with
being traitors to the nation.  To such a height did they
carry their barbarity, as to cast forth the mangled
remains of these priestly men to be devoured by dogs and
birds of prey, in defiance of the superstitious veneration
which had ever been entertained by the Jews towards
the bodies of the dead.  Had Ananus lived, doubtless
the affairs of Jerusalem might have terminated more
favourably; but her time was come, and it pleased God
to remove all obstacles to the fulfilment of his righteous
decree.  With the venerable Ananus expired all hopes
of peace with the Romans, and all prospect of tranquillity
in the city; and the Jewish historian dates the utter
ruin of Jerusalem from the death of this deeply-regretted
man.
</p>

<p>
Having exercised their cruelty on these distinguished
persons, the Idumeans raged with uncontrollable fury
among the rest of the inhabitants, and slew multitudes
of the meaner sort like so many wild beasts; but the
young men and the nobles they cast into prison, in the
hope that they might be induced to join their party.  Not
one complied with their wishes, and though scourged
and tortured they yet resolutely endured, until their
tormentors put an end to their sufferings by death.
</p>

<p>
During the bloody scenes of this terrific night, of
which we have given but a faint sketch, the family of
Zadok were agitated by the deepest anxiety.  A few
days previous to the arrival of the Idumeans, Naomi
had left the city with her uncle Amaziah, and his wife
Judith, to reside for a short time with them in a beautiful
country-house which they possessed near the village of
Bethany.  Her return was expected on that fatal day,
when a host of barbarous enemies so suddenly and
unexpectedly appeared before the walls of Jerusalem.  The
gates were immediately closed and strictly guarded, and
orders were issued that no person should, on any
pretence, be allowed either to pass in or out of the city.
Zadok was hastily summoned to assist the council of
Ananus; and in trembling anxiety did Salome, and
Claudia, and the aged Deborah, remain seated on the
housetop, looking out over the dense multitude of
Idumeans beneath the walls, and straining their eyes in the
direction in which they expected Naomi and her friends
to approach.  What might be their fate if they came
within sight of the barbarous invaders?&mdash;and from the
hollow situation in which the Idumeans were encamped,
they could not be perceived by those descending the
Mount of Olives, until they might be so near them as to
render escape impossible.
</p>

<p>
In this emergency, what course could be pursued, and
how would it be practicable to send intelligence to
Amaziah of the alarming state of the city!  Salome at length
resolved to go herself to Ananus, and entreat his aid and
counsel.  The present state of suspense was not to be
borne, and any danger was preferable to the chance of
her lovely and beloved daughter falling into the hands
of the barbarians.  The dreadful thought inspired even
the timid Salome with courage; and covering herself
with a thick veil, she descended from the flat roof of her
dwelling, and went forth into the crowded and tumultuous
streets, followed by several armed servants, and
accompanied by the faithful Deborah, who could not be
persuaded to remain behind.
</p>

<p>
The way by which Salome had to pass to the house
of Ananus was thronged with men, many of them
armed, and all in a state of great excitement.  The
adverse parties which tore the city with their dissensions
were not united by the common danger that now threatened
them, and loud and angry were the voices that fell
on the ears of the trembling Salome as she hastily
pursued her way through the crowd, and expected every
moment to be assailed by the rude hands of robbery and
violence.  Happily the minds of all men were so much
occupied with the dangers that then menaced the city,
that Salome and her little group of attendants passed
unnoticed, and reached the lofty portico in front of
dwelling of Ananus in safety.  The marble stops were
crowded with priests and elders, and the chief men of
the city, who were hurrying to and fro, to execute the
orders of Ananus, or to join in the deliberations that
were going forward in the council-chamber.  Salome
was at first unheeded, and sought in vain to obtain
admittance to the chief-priest; but at length she raised her
veil to look around among the throng for some one with
whom she was acquainted, and who would conduct her
to Ananus.  The first countenance that met her gaze
was that of Zadok, who started with surprise and alarm
at beholding his gentle and timid wife so far from her
home, and exposed to the tumult and disorder of the
excited populace.
</p>

<p>
He hastily approached her, and inquired what could
have led her forth at such a time.  And when Salome
felt that she was leaning on the arm of her intrepid and
high-minded husband her confidence returned, and she
quickly told him the object that had brought her thither,
and had made her almost forget her own danger in
anxiety for the safety of Naomi.  In the hurry and
occupation of the last few hours, it had not occurred to
Zadok that his daughter had appointed that day for her
return to the city, and thus might be exposed to the
peril of falling into the power of the Idumeans.  But
now his whole soul was filled with apprehension on her
account; and, accompanied by Salome, he hastily entered
the council-chamber, and entreated that he might be
permitted to go out of the city by one of the gates the
furthest removed from the Idumean camp, and endeavour
to make his way by secret paths to the house of Amaziah,
in the hope that he might be in time to warn him of the
danger of approaching the city.
</p>

<p>
Ananus hesitated; he was most unwilling to be
deprived of the council and the assistance of Zadok at a
period of so much danger and anxiety; and he also
dreaded his falling into the hands of the enemy, who
would show no mercy to one who was well known to be
his friend and adviser.  But the perilous situation of
Naomi and her relations moved him, and he demanded
whether no other person of courage and fidelity could be
found who would go on the errand, and who could be
better spared than Zadok, in case it should be found
impossible to return into the city.  The mission was a
dangerous one, and who could be found ready to undertake
it?  Zadok again requested that he might himself go
forth, and promised at all risks to attempt a speedy
return.  At that moment Theophilus, the son of
Amaziah, entered the apartment, and begged permission
instantly to depart from the city and seek his father.  He
had been to the house of Zadok, and there Claudia had
informed him of Salome's fears, and her errand to
Ananus, and he had hurried after her to offer himself as
the messenger.
</p>

<p>
Ananus gave his consent, and Salome saw the brave
youth depart, with a feeling of joy that her husband was
not exposed to the perils of the enterprise.  Zadok then
himself conducted her home, and immediately returned
to the council; while his wife and Claudia again took
their station among the flowering shrubs with which the
roof was thickly planted, and from whence, unobserved
by the crowds beneath them, they could perceive the
movements of the multitudes both within and without
the walls, and watch for the distant figure of Theophilus
when he should pass over the highest part of the road
to Bethany.
</p>

<p>
The day closed in, and darkness covered the scene
with even greater suddenness than usual, for thick clouds
had gathered over the sky, and the sun went down into
a red and lurid horizon.  Soon the rain fell heavily, and
Salome and her young companion were forced to leave
the housetop and take refuge in their apartment, where
they passed the whole of that tremendous night in fear
and watchfulness, listening to the warring elements
without, and trembling when, amid the fury of the
tempest, they heard the savage shouts of the Idumeans and
the nearer cries of the fugitives from the temple.
</p>

<p>
Zadok had not returned to his home that night; at
the close of the evening he had sent a messenger to
inform his wife that the deliberations were still
continued, but that before midnight he purposed going the
rounds of the guard with Ananus, and would afterwards
hasten back to his family.  Midnight came, but
then the storm raged furiously, and Salome hoped that
Zadok was safe in the house of Ananus.  As the hours
passed slowly on, the terrors of that night increased,
and Salome knew from the tumult and the shouts, that
some fierce commotion was going on in the city.  Her
fears were strongly excited for Zadok, who being with
Ananus, and well known to be a powerful supporter of
his party, would be exposed to the vengeance of the
Zealots, if they had broken forth from the temple.
</p>

<p>
Fervently did she implore the Divine protection to
shield him from harm, while Claudia and Deborah
joined their prayers to hers; and amid all their fears
and anxiety, they could not but rejoice that Naomi at
least was removed from this scene of terror, and, as they
hoped, yet enjoying a temporary peace in her uncle's
house.
</p>

<p>
When the day began to dawn, they looked forth into
the street, and though their dwelling was near the walls,
and situated at a considerable distance from the
principal thoroughfares, where the work of carnage had been
chiefly performed, yet numbers of human bodies were
scattered on the ground&mdash;the mangled remains of those
who had fled to this secluded part of the city for refuge,
but had been pursued and murdered by their savage
enemies.  No living beings were to be seen in the
desolate street, except a few lean and hungry dogs which
had crept out to tear and devour the yet warm carcases
that promised them an ample meal; but the din of war
and cries of agony and fear resounded from the temple
and the higher parts of the city.  Salome's heart
sickened, and she turned away: might not her noble, her
beloved husband, be already as one of these lifeless
corpses?  In agony of mind she wept, and poured out
her soul before the Lord.
</p>

<p>
Her attention was recalled by a loud exclamation of
joy from Claudia.  "Oh, Salome," she cried, "here is
Theophilus.  He is approaching the house, and doubtless
he brings tidings of our dear Naomi."  The affectionate
girl ran swiftly down to the court; and unbarring
the heavy gate that opened into the street, she even
ventured several paces beyond the threshold in her
eagerness to know the fate of her friend.  Theophilus
assured her that Naomi was safe; and then having
carefully secured the gate, he followed her to the vestibule,
where Salome met them, and there hastily told them the
particulars of his expedition.  He had narrowly escaped
being taken by some scattered parties of the Idumeans,
and had only saved himself by his swiftness in running,
and his intimate knowledge of the paths through the
groves and orchards by which he had to pass.  He had
happily succeeded in eluding his pursuers, but only just
in time to prevent the cavalcade of Amaziah and his
family from ascending the hill on the eastern side, and
appearing in full view of the Idumean sentinels.  His
father had received no intelligence of the arrival of their
army, and was returning with Judith and Naomi to the
city, as he had appointed.  On hearing the disastrous
news, however, he immediately turned back, and
hastened again to the house from which he had come.
There he placed his wife and Naomi, in as great security
as the circumstances would permit, and left all his
servants well armed under the direction of his faithful
steward Josiah, to protect them from any wandering
bands of robbers, or Idumeans.  Amaziah had then
accompanied Theophilus back to the city, and in the
darkness and tumult of the storm, which had become
violent by the time they reached the walls, they had
escaped the observation of the Idumeans, and passed
safely to their own house.  There they had remained
until the shouts of the Zealots and their allies had
aroused them to a knowledge of the distracted state of
Jerusalem, and called them from the shelter of their
home, to mingle in the tumult, and give their aid
in opposing the massacres and pillage that were going
forward.
</p>

<p>
Their efforts to reach Ananus had been in vain, for
they found his dwelling entirely surrounded by a dense
crowd of infuriated Zealots, crying loudly for his blood;
and Amaziah had therefore again retired to his home,
with a few of his friends, to seek some means of
succouring the chief-priest and restoring order to the city;
"While I," continued Theophilus, "have hastened to
you, Salome, to satisfy your mind of the safety of your
daughter, and to inquire whether my uncle is with you,
for my father earnestly desires to confer with him."
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" cried Salome, "Zadok has not appeared at
home during the whole of this dreadful night.  He was
with Ananus when the storm commenced, and I have
remained in the agony of suspense ever since.  I know
not whether he yet lives, or whether the ruffians who
now rage through the city have destroyed the noblest,
the wisest, the most virtuous man who dwelt within its
walls.  Oh, Theophilus! he is your father's only
brother!&mdash;will you not endeavour to save him? or will you not
at least seek for some intelligence of his fate, and let me
know the worst?  If he is slain&mdash;oh!&mdash;save his sacred
form from the insults of the murderers.  Bear it to me,
and let me once more behold, though lifeless, that
countenance which is dearer to me than all on earth beside.
Take with you all the men of our household; we have
many faithful servants, and they are well provided with
arms.  They will risk their lives to save their master,
or to rescue his honoured remains from the sacrilegious
hands of the Zealots.  Go, summon the domestics, and
sally forth.  Lose not a moment, and the blessing of a
breaking heart shall be with you."
</p>

<p>
Theophilus was deeply moved by the grief of Salome,
and the danger of his uncle.  He had seen the house of
Ananus beset by the Zealots, and he knew that Zadok
would find no mercy from them.  He did not however
add to the fears of Salome by expressing his own; but
hastily complied with her entreaties, and set out, attended
by all the servants except two or three, whom he charged
to guard the gate, and on no account to open it until
his return.
</p>

<p>
His absence was long.  To Salome it appeared
endless; and more than once she and Claudia ventured to
the housetop and looked along the street, in the hope of
seeing him return.  Once the sound of coming footsteps
made her heart beat violently, and she gazed out in
hope and in fear; but it was only a party of wretched
women and children flying down the street, and soon
appeared their pursuers, with drawn swords reeking
with blood, and gained rapidly on the miserable
fugitives.  Salome and Claudia retreated with a cry of
horror.  They saw not the massacre, but the shrieks
that rose upon their ears told them but too plainly
that the work of death was done.  The ruffians turned
towards their dwelling, and they heard them loudly
demanding an entrance, and even striking at the gate with
their swords.  But it was too strong for their efforts,
and they were already almost satiated with plunder and
carnage.  They retreated, and the trembling inmates
heard them pass along the street, which echoed with their
wild shouts and impious songs.
</p>

<p>
All Salome's resolutions and endurance were exhausted.
Her naturally timid spirit had been roused to
unusual excitement and energy; but these feelings had
subsided, and she sank into a state of exhaustion, and
almost of stupor.  Had Zadok been by her side, she
would have felt some confidence, but his absence and
her apprehensions for his safety were more than she
could bear.  Even if Naomi had been with her she
would have been some support.  Her sanguine temper
and courageous spirit would have suggested fresh hope
and inspired fresh confidence; but Claudia was unable to
administer comfort which she did not feel, or to combat
terrors that filled her own breast also.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Theophilus and his band of armed servants
hurried along the streets towards the house of Ananus.
Every dwelling which they passed appeared to be
deserted; for where the inhabitants had not either been
slain, or fled to some cave or hiding-place for refuge,
they had carefully closed and barricadoed every gate
and entrance to their houses, and remained concealed
within, expecting the arrival of the Zealots and
Idumeans, to rob, to murder, and to destroy.  The
pavements were strewed with human bodies, and stained
with gore: it seemed a "city of the dead;" but the
peacefulness of death was not there&mdash;the tumult had
not ceased.  The murderers had only gone further in
quest of other victims, and richer plunder; and the
sounds of conflict and slaughter were audible in the
distance.
</p>

<p>
Theophilus reached the splendid dwelling of Ananus.
The crowd had abandoned it; and the open gates and
scattered wreck of costly furniture told that the work of
destruction was completed, and that the venerable priest
no longer dwelt in his marble halls.  It was evident
that a severe contest had been maintained on the grand
flight of steps leading to the entrance; for there the
dead bodies of the combatants lay heaped together; and
beneath the dreadful burden Theophilus beheld the robe
of Zadok.  It was a garment of fringes, the work of
Naomi's hands, and he well remembered to have seen
his uncle attired in it when he met him the previous
evening in the council-chamber.  His worst fears were
then realized; and the noble Zadok had fallen, probably
in the defence of his friend and chieftain; and all that
he could now do for the wretched Salome, would be to
carry home the lifeless body of her husband, and thus
afford her the melancholy satisfaction of bedewing it
with her tears, and rendering to the honoured clay the
holy rites of sepulture, so sacred to the heart of a Jew.
No sooner did the servants perceive the body of their
master, than they broke forth into loud cries of grief and
rage, and demanded vengeance with all the vehemence
of their national character; but Theophilus commanded
them to be silent, and to lose no time in disengaging
the corpse from its present situation, and bearing it
away; for he feared that their outcries might attract
the attention of the Idumeans, who were prowling all
over the city, and that their object might then be
frustrated.  Hastily the men obeyed him; and having
removed the mangled carcases that lay heavily above the
body of Zadok, they raised it from the ground, and
carried it into the vestibule, that they might procure a
couch on which to transport it home.
</p>

<p>
They were startled on entering by a rustling sound,
as of some person escaping from the vestibule; and on
following the steps of the fugitive, they overtook one of
the domestics of Ananus, who had escaped the notice
of the murderers, and was anxiously watching for an
opportunity to flee from the palace unobserved, when
he saw a party of armed men enter the house, and
concluded that they belonged to the Zealot party.  The
eight of Theophilus, who was well known to him, restored
his courage; and he immediately directed his attendants
where to procure a couch, on which the body was
immediately laid, and a richly embroidered curtain, which
had been dropped by the plunderers, was thrown over
it.  The servants placed their long spears beneath the
couch, and in this manner carried it forth into the street
and proceeded, with the greatest possible expedition
towards their home.  They were within a few paces of
the gate, when a party of drunken Idumeans sallied out
of a neighbouring house loaded with spoil, and placing
themselves before the melancholy cavalcade, demanded
what they were thus secretly carrying away?  On being
informed that it was merely the body of a friend, they
tauntingly replied, that dead bodies were now too
plentiful to be worth so much trouble, and insisted on
uncovering the corpse.  To avoid a struggle, Theophilus
raised the lower end of the covering, and when the
ruffians saw that it was really a human body, they
uttered a shout of derision, and one of them wantonly
cast a javelin at the corpse, which pierced the arm, and
the blood flowed profusely over the damask curtain.
The Idumeans knew not the rank of Theophilus, nor
were they aware that it was the body of Zadok, the
friend of Ananus, that was being carried to its rest,
otherwise they would probably have attempted to wrest it
from the attendants; but satisfied with insulting it, they
went on their way to seek more profitable adventures.
</p>

<p>
At the voice of Theophilus, the servants left on guard
unclosed the massy gates, and uttered a cry of despair
when they beheld the bier.  The cry reached Salome's
ears, and roused her to animation.  She rose to rush
forward and ascertain the cause, but her trembling
limbs refused to support her, and she sank again into
her seat, with a feeble sign to Claudia to hasten to the
court.  Claudia flew along the gallery, and met the
procession at the entrance of the hall.  The whole sad
truth rushed upon her mind, and in deep grief she
returned to her afflicted friend.  Pale and speechless
she appeared before Salome, and when she met her
inquiring gaze, she replied only by a burst of tears.
Salome saw that all hope was over, and a deep swoon
deprived her for a time of the consciousness of her
bereavement.
</p>

<p>
When at length she recovered, she desired instantly
to be led to the spot where her husband was laid; and
leaning on Claudia and her faithful Deborah, she entered
the hall.  In the centre of the marble pavement stood
the funeral couch, yet covered with embroidered drapery.
With a desperate effort Salome approached, and raising
the drapery, she sunk upon her knees with a passionate
exclamation of despair, to gaze upon the beloved but
motionless countenance.  Oh what words shall tell her
feelings when she heard a struggling sigh from Zadok's
lips, and saw those eyes which she believed to be closed
for ever, slowly open, and fix upon her face a look
of wonder and of love!  She thought her brain was
wandering, and covered her eyes that she might not
cheat her heart with vain delusions.  But then the voice
of Zadok came upon her ear as if it had been the voice
of an angel, and though weak and faltering, she could
not doubt those tones.  The ecstasy, the gratitude, the
wonder, that filled and overpowered her heart, may not
be described by any human pen.  Those who know
what it is to recover once again a being dearer far to
them than their own life, alone can know what Salome
felt.
</p>

<p>
Restoratives were quickly procured, and in a short
time Zadok was sufficiently recovered to relate the events
which had occurred, previous to the time when he was
struck to the earth by a heavy blow from the butt of a
broken spear; and ere his senses returned, he must have
been buried beneath the bodies that rapidly fell around
him.  Ananus had that night, as we have seen, omitted
to go his usual rounds to inspect the guard, but had
continued in deep consultation with the counsellors until
long after midnight.  Their deliberations were at length
interrupted by a sudden and violent uproar, and on
going to the entrance to discover the cause, they saw by
the light of torches, that the street was filled with
armed men.  A shout, as if from a host of demons,
greeted the appearance of the priests and elders, and a
furious rush was made by the Zealots up the flight of
steps, on the summit of which they were standing.
Vain was it to address them; and vain would it have
been to fly.  A struggle for life or death was maintained
a few moments, but overpowered by numbers, they
quickly fell.  Zadok knew not the fate of Ananus: it
was in warding off a blow aimed at the head of his chief
that he had been struck to the earth, and remained
insensible to the conclusion of the tragic scene.
</p>

<p>
The servant of Ananus, who had accompanied Theophilus
to Zadok's house, now informed him that the aged
priest had been seized and slain, and that with him was
murdered Jesus, the son of Gamala.  Their bodies were
dragged away by the savage troop, and he feared must
have been subject to the grossest indignities.
</p>

<p>
Zadok groaned when he heard that Ananus had fallen.
He loved and respected him as a friend; and in him
alone had he placed any confidence, as the means of
restoring peace to his distracted country.  But his
present weakness prevented him from taking any active
measures, and forced him to think of his own
preservation and recovery.  The wound which had been so
cruelly inflicted by the Idumean, had in fact been the
cause of his restoration to life; for the blood had flowed
freely, and combined with the rapid motion and fresh
air, had removed the stupor consequent on the blow
he had received, and which might doubtless have ended
in death had not circulation been restored by the javelin
of the robber.
</p>

<p>
It was a very happy circumstance that the fall of
Zadok had been seen by many of the Zealots, and that
the belief of his death became general, otherwise his
well-known character would have exposed him and his
family to destruction.  And as his weakness compelled
him, though most unwillingly, to remain idle within his
own walls, no inquiries were made about him; and his
house was left unmolested, except by wandering bands
of robbers, who found the gates too strong for their
efforts.  Amaziah, who had passed that night of horror
in active exertions to assist the unoffending inhabitants,
repaired to his brother's house, when he found he
could no longer be of service in the contest, and that
the Zealots were complete masters of the city.  He had
heard and believed that Zadok was slain, and his joy
was great at finding his brother alive, when he had
only hoped to be a support and protection to his widow.
He only remained a few days with his brother, and then
returned to his anxious wife, leaving Theophilus as a
comfort to Salome and Claudia.
</p>

<p>
For many days the massacre continued, until at
length the Zealots were weary of such indiscriminate
slaughter, and affected to set up the forms of justice.
They composed a Sanhedrim of seventy of the populace,
and before this court they arraigned Zacharias, the
son of Baruch, a man of worth and high character,
and with no fault but that of being rich and patriotic.
The Zealots thirsted for his wealth and his blood; and
they accused him of holding correspondence with the
Romans.
</p>

<p>
Zacharias boldly defended himself from their charges,
and despairing of saving his life, he ridiculed his accusers,
and set them at defiance, and even reproached them
with their iniquity and injustice.  The Zealots drew
their swords, but ere they used them, they called on the
judges to condemn the innocent victim.  The Sanhedrim
unanimously acquitted the prisoner, and declared that
they would die with him rather than condemn him to
death.
</p>

<p>
Then the fury of the Zealots broke forth, and two of
them rushing forward, struck Zacharias dead, as he
stood undaunted in the court of the holy temple.  They
then dragged the body along the pavement, and cast it
into the abyss below.  They beat the judges with their
swords, and drove them out of the court with every
indignity.
</p>

<p>
The Idumeans, now satiated with plunder and revenge,
began to repent of the bloody work in which they were
engaged, and declared that they had come to Jerusalem
to defend the city against the Romans, and not to share
in murder and rapine; and they announced their
intention of abandoning the Zealots to themselves.  Before
they departed, however, they opened all the prisons,
and released two thousand of the people, who immediately
fled away and joined Simon the son of Gioras.  The
populace, relieved of the presence of the Idumeans,
began to resume their confidence, and many ventured
out in open daylight, to gather up the bodies of their
friends for burial, or to cast over them a little earth
where they lay, to protect them from the birds of prey
and ravenous dogs.  But the Zealots did not lay aside
their power or their cruelty, with the departure of their
allies; they continued their lawless iniquities, and every
day fresh victims fell.
</p>

<p>
The state of the city was well known to Vespasian,
and his friends besought him to march to the capital,
and at once put an end to the war.  But he preferred
leaving it to its own inward distractions, which he was
convinced would soon bring it to utter weakness; and
he was encouraged in this opinion by the multitude of
deserters who every day flocked to his camp; though
some of these afterwards returned to Jerusalem of their
own accord, that they might die in the holy city, so
great was their attachment to the hallowed spot.
</p>

<p>
During all this confusion, John of Gischala pursued
his ambitious schemes; and at length all the real authority
and power was centred in him.  The Zealots now
formed two parties; one surrounded John as a despotic
chief, the other composed a lawless democracy; and
both vied with each other in cruelty and oppression
towards the people.  To add to the miseries of war,
tyranny, and sedition, the Sicarii or Assassins, who had
obtained possession of the fortress of Massada near the
Dead Sea, now sallied out and surprised Engaddi, during
the night of the passover (A.D. 68), and slew about
seven hundred persons.  Other bands collected in the
neighbouring regions, and the whole country was filled
with confusion and rapine.

CHAPTER VIII.
</h3>

<p>
Far different to the scenes we have just described were
those which Naomi was called to witness; and had not
her mind been harassed with anxiety for her beloved
parents and her young friend Claudia, she would have
considered the days which she passed with her relatives,
in their beautiful country residence, as the happiest of her
life.  It was not that the scenery around her was lovely,
and the air was fresh and pure, in the elevated spot on
which the house was situated; nor was it because Amaziah
and Judith had always loved her as a daughter, and
now treated her with the most affectionate kindness, that
Naomi felt it was a blessed privilege to be under their
peaceful roof.  On the first evening of her arrival with
her relatives at their country-house, Judith had proposed
to her that they should walk to Bethany; and to the
surprise of Naomi, they no sooner entered the village than
her aunt proceeded to the cottage where Mary dwelt.
</p>

<p>
The aged Christian was alone; but solitude was not sad
to her, for the bright prospects of futurity, and the blessed
remembrances of the past, shed a heavenly light over her
lonely and humble abode.  She rose to meet her visitors
with a smile of cheerful welcome; and Naomi was startled
and almost terrified when she saluted her, in the hearing
of her aunt, with her accustomed benediction, "The
blessing of our Lord and Saviour be upon you, my child."
</p>

<p>
Judith saw what was passing in her mind, and hastened
to remove her apprehensions.  She took her hand, and
said, "I have brought you here, my dear Naomi, that in
the presence of our venerable friend I may acknowledge
to you that I also am an unworthy disciple of that Lord
and Saviour whose name you have been taught to worship.
She who has been the blessed instrument of bringing you
to the knowledge of the truth, was also the means of
removing the dark cloud of error and prejudice that hung
over my mind and that of Amaziah.  Many years have
elapsed since the happy change took place; but our
safety required that it should be kept secret; and as so
much of our time has been passed in the country, our
renunciation of the religion of our forefathers was not
discovered.  Often have I wished and prayed that the
time might come when I could be permitted to instruct
you, Naomi, in the truths of Christianity; but I felt that
I should be abusing the confidence reposed in me by your
parents if I attempted to do so without their knowledge
and consent.  The very strong prejudice which your
excellent father entertains against the disciples of Jesus,
made it hopeless for me to expect that consent; and I
could only offer up my fervent prayers, that in his own
good time the Lord would call you to the knowledge of
himself.  My prayers have been answered, and you may
imagine my feelings of joy and gratitude when Mary
informed me that you had confessed your sincere faith in
the Son of God."
</p>

<p>
Naomi's astonishment was only equalled by her delight
at finding that her beloved relatives were also united to
her in the bonds of one faith, and one hope in Christ.
</p>

<p>
"Now," she exclaimed, "I shall feel that I am not
alone and divided from all I love on earth.  Oh that my
father and my mother, and my poor misguided brother
would also believe in the Redeemer, and find that rest to
their souls which I never knew, until I was convinced
that in him my sins were blotted out, and that by his
death my salvation was purchased.  And all this I owe
to you, my excellent&mdash;my beloved teacher.  I saw that
amid poverty, and persecution, and infirmity, you were
happier than the wealthiest, the proudest of the
self-righteous Jews with whom I was acquainted; and I felt
sure that nothing but a true faith could produce the
heavenly calm that reigned over your soul.  And when
I heard of the love and pity, the wisdom and power of
Him in whom you put your trust, I could no longer
wonder at your joy and peace; and thankfully I acknowledge,
that, in a humble degree, the same faith and the
same hope now animate my soul."
</p>

<p>
Long and interesting was the conversation of these
Christian friends; and Judith informed her niece of the
particulars of her own and her husband's conversion to
Christianity, and their admission by baptism into the
church of Christ at Jerusalem.  Theophilus had also
sincerely embraced the same religion, and had received
the sacred rite several years since.  Naomi was surprised
to find how numerous had been the company of Christians
in Jerusalem; until the period when James, the brother of
the Lord, and the first bishop of that city, was murdered.
</p>

<p>
"Since that unhappy event, which you, Naomi, must
well remember," added Judith, "the church has been
dispersed and persecuted; and those of its members who
have remained in Jerusalem have feared to appear so
openly as they ventured to do during the life of that
upright and excellent man."
</p>

<p>
"I do remember his death," replied Naomi, "and I
also well remember my father's indignation at the cruel
manner in which he was slain.  Though he looked upon
James the Just as a mistaken and deluded man, and
despised his religion, yet I have often heard both him and
his friends say that he well deserved the title which was
bestowed on him of 'the fortress of the people,' for that
he commanded the love and admiration of the whole city,
from his divine temper, and his meekness and humility.
My father even once declared, since the troubles of our
nation commenced, that he considered the barbarous
murder of that righteous and venerable man as a principal
means of bringing the wrath and the chastisements of
God upon the city.  He was present when James was led
to the top of the temple-wall, and placed there in sight of
the collected multitude below, in the hope that he would
declare to them his conviction that Jesus of Nazareth was
not the long-promised Messiah; and he shared in the
general disappointment when, instead of doing as was
expected, the venerable saint lifted up his voice, and
loudly proclaimed that Jesus was the Son of God.  But
my father did not join in the cry to hurl him from the
wall&mdash;he would have saved his life, if possible; but the
infuriated populace cast him down the precipice.  I have
seen the tears in Zadok's eyes, when he has described
to us the old man rising on his knees after the fall, in
which he miraculously escaped being killed, and with
uplifted hands praying for mercy on his persecutors.
Oh! how hard must have been the hearts of those who could
behold him thus, and not be moved to pity, but stoned
him as he knelt!  If he were living now, with what
different feelings should I regard him from those which
I entertained when, as a child, I learned to call him
Nazarene, as a term of reproach, though even then I
never saw his holy countenance without an emotion of
awe and veneration!"
</p>

<p>
"His presence was indeed a blessing, and his death
a calamity, both to Christians and to Jews," replied
Judith.  "He was the only one of the sacred band of
apostles whom I ever knew, though I remember to have
seen several of them during my youth, before they were
dispersed and scattered into distant nations, when Herod
stretched forth his hands to vex the church.  Mary has
been more highly blessed, for she was acquainted with all
those chosen men, and still more blessed was she in being
permitted to enjoy the presence and share the friendship
of the Saviour himself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," paid Mary, "my eyes have seen those things
which many prophets and kings have desired to see, and
have not seen&mdash;I have seen the Lord Jesus in his human
nature, and in his humility: and now all the desire of
my heart is to behold the King in his beauty, and see
him on the throne of his father David.  When he comes
in his majesty every eye shall see him, and all shall
equally confess that he is the Son of God.  But oh! how
will those regard him then who have rejected him in his
low estate?  And how will they stand before his throne
of judgment who have despised his offers of mercy?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it the belief of the Christians," asked Naomi, "that
the Messiah will speedily return in his glory?"
</p>

<p>
"The church looks for his coming," replied Mary,
"both speedily and suddenly.  Some of our brethren
even expect his appearance during the life of his only
remaining apostle John.  But this arises from their
misunderstanding the words of the Lord to Peter, when,
after the resurrection of his Master, that disciple inquired
of him what should be the fate of the beloved John.
'If I will that he tarry till I come,' said Jesus, 'what is
that to thee?'  And therefore a saying went abroad
that John should not die until the Lord came again.
But he himself did not so understand it: and he is now
at Ephesus, anxiously awaiting the hour when he shall
be summoned by death into the presence of that Lord
whom on earth he loved so devotedly."
</p>

<p>
"And is John still living, then?" exclaimed Naomi.
"I supposed that none remained on earth who had seen
the Saviour, except you, Mary."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the highly-favoured and divine apostle John is
still alive, though of a great age.  He governs the
churches in Asia, and edifies the believers in every
nation by his pious and holy writings, which all breathe
the same spirit of Christian love and tenderness that
shines so brightly in his own life and character.  But
John was not always the angelic being that I have
described him to you.  I knew him in his youth, ere the
voice of Jesus had called him to be his disciple; and
then both he and his brother James were impetuous and
fiery of temper.  It was the love of Jesus that changed
his heart, and made him what he is.  His Master's
character was reflected in that of the disciple whom
Jesus loved."
</p>

<p>
"Surely the same effect will, in some measure, be
observed in every one who contemplates the graces that
were displayed in the life of the blessed Redeemer,"
observed Judith.  "We cannot look on him with our
bodily eyes, but by faith we may behold him; and the
more we love him the more we shall strive to be like
him.  Already, my dearest Naomi, I perceive something
of this change in you.  Your countenance no longer
expresses the same pride and self-confidence that I have
always lamented in your character; and your manner is
meek and gentle, like that of one who has renounced all
human pride and human dependence, and consented to
learn of Him who was meek and lowly of heart: and
oh, may you thus find rest unto your soul&mdash;that rest
which He has promised, and that peace which He alone
can give.  I would not wish, my child, to take from you
one spark of the enthusiasm that is now directed to so
noble an object, or to weaken that firmness and
resolution which have always marked your disposition, and
may one day be called for to enable you to bear the trials
and sufferings of life.  By God's grace these qualities
will now be properly guided and controlled, and we shall
see you, through good report and evil report, through
persecutions and afflictions, or in the more dangerous
trials of prosperity, exhibiting that singleness of heart
and courageous determination to honour your Master's
name that should always characterize his true disciples.
Alas! that some should so sadly have fallen short of this
resolution and courage, even among his earliest and most
privileged disciples!"
</p>

<p>
"It is because I now feel the sinfulness of my own
heart that I am not the proud creature I used to be,"
replied Naomi.  "When I consider the purity and
holiness of my Redeemer's life, and compare my own corrupt
inclinations, and evil thoughts and actions, with his
faultless character, surely I must feel humbled in the
dust.  But when I remember that that divine Being shed
his blood to wash away my sins, can I fear any sufferings,
any trials, by which I may prove my love and
gratitude?  Oh! sometimes," she continued, clasping
her hands fervently, while her eyes sparkled through
tears of enthusiastic emotion,&mdash;"sometimes I envy the
apostles, and the blessed martyr Stephen, and all those
holy Christians who have already been called to shed
their blood in confirmation of their faith!"
</p>

<p>
"Trust not, my beloved Naomi, to your present ardent
feelings," interrupted Mary, in a gentle voice, "nor
suffer yourself to be too confident in the firmness of your
faith.  I pray God that you maybe endued with strength
by his Spirit, to carry you triumphantly through every
trial that he deems fit to send upon you; but I covet
neither for you nor for myself the sore temptations
to which some of our brethren have already been
exposed.  Remember how Peter, the brave, the lion-hearted
Peter, failed in the hour of danger, because
he trusted in his own strength and boasted of his own
courage."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I do remember that sad event," replied the
young Christian, somewhat abashed at the mild reproof
of Mary.  "That denial of Peter, and the desertion of
their Master by all his disciples at the last, have always
been a source of astonishment to me.  I have frequently
heard it related by my father, and the rabbis who
frequent his house, as a strong argument against the truth
of the Christian doctrines, and the belief of the disciples
in the divinity of their Master.  And even when I
considered Jesus of Nazareth as merely a human teacher,
and perhaps also as an impostor, I still wondered that
those who had dwelt with him, and followed him, and
professed to believe in him, should forsake him in his
hour of sorrow and suffering."
</p>

<p>
"It is indeed a humbling proof of the weakness and
depravity and selfishness of the human heart," answered
Mary; "and for this reason it has been faithfully
recorded by some of the apostles themselves, as you have
seen in the precious copy which I possess of the life of
Jesus Christ, written by Matthew the publican.  At the
time of the Redeemer's death the Holy Spirit of God
had not descended upon his disciples, and without the
aid of that Spirit none can hope to stand in the time of
trial.  All must be born again, as our Lord himself
informed Nicodemus, or they cannot enter the kingdom
of God&mdash;they cannot belong to Christ on earth, or dwell
with him in heaven.  But when the apostles were endued
with power from on high, according to the promise of
their Master, then they were enabled to declare the
truth with boldness, and to endure a great fight of
afflictions, and at last to receive the crown of martyrdom, and
enter into their rest with songs of rejoicing.  In the
strength of the same Spirit which supported them can
we alone hope to stand, and for that Spirit let us
unceasingly pray."
</p>

<p>
"But, Mary," asked Naomi, "can we expect that the
Holy Spirit will descend visibly upon us, as you have
told me it did upon the apostles, and give us power to
work miracles, and speak with tongues as they did?
Neither you nor Judith possess those gifts, and yet I
feel sure that you are the true disciples of Jesus."
</p>

<p>
"No, my daughter, those gifts are now very rare; for
as the Gospel of Christ has spread already over so great
a part of the world, and many of almost all nations have
been converted, the gift of tongues is no longer necessary.
And doubtless also, the miracles that were worked
so abundantly by our Lord and his first disciples, were
intended in a great measure to prove that Jesus was the
Son of God, and possessed the power of God, and that
his disciples were his true servants and his authorized
witnesses.  Those miracles cannot now be denied; they
were seen by multitudes, and have been recorded by
eye-witnesses, who have moreover sealed the truth of
their declarations with their blood; and therefore the
proof which they convey will remain to all ages, and
needs not to be renewed by fresh manifestations of Divine
power.  The Holy Spirit now no longer descends in a
visible manner, but his influence may be clearly
discerned in the heart, by increasing love to God and to
his Holy Son Jesus, and greater zeal in his service."
</p>

<p>
"Then may I hope," asked Naomi, "that the Lord
has sent his Spirit into my heart?  It u still full of evil;
and every day I see that evil more clearly, and lament it
more deeply; but then I also hope that I love the Lord
Jesus more and more, and feel more desirous to do his
will and walk in his steps."
</p>

<p>
"The feelings you describe," replied Mary, "and
which I believe to be sincere, are the best proof of the
presence of God's Spirit in your heart.  May he ever
abide with you, and strengthen you day by day for the
service of the Lord, until you enter into that world where
God has prepared such joys as eye hath not seen nor ear
heard, neither have entered into the heart of man to
conceive, but which shall be the portion of all those who
love Him."
</p>

<p>
Naomi was moved at the affectionate earnestness of
her aged friend; she silently embraced her, and as
Judith now rose to depart she followed her from the
cottage.  The sun was setting as they left the village,
and they hastened forward while the short twilight of an
eastern climate yet remained to guide them.  Their way
led through groves and orchards and rocky ravines, and
they regretted that they had been induced to remain so
long at Bethany, for though this part of the country had
hitherto been undisturbed by the bands of robbers who
infested the more distant regions, yet Judith and her
young companion felt alarmed at finding themselves
alone, so far from home, and in the rapidly increasing
darkness.  They had entered a thick grove of olive-trees,
and were with some difficulty tracing the narrow
path that led through it, when they were startled by
perceiving several lights at some distance before them,
and evidently approaching towards the spot where they
stood.  Hastily they concealed themselves among the
thickest branches of the dark olive-trees, and waited in
trembling anxiety until the dreaded party should pass.
The lights came nearer and nearer, and those who
carried them raised loud and frequent shouts, which added
to the terror of Judith, until Naomi, whose eye and ear
were quicker, and whose presence of mind was greater,
started from her hiding-place and exclaimed, "It is
Amaziah's voice! and now I see his tall figure
advancing through the bushes.  No doubt he has come to
meet us."
</p>

<p>
"True, my child," replied Judith; "I ought first to
have recognised his voice and suspected his anxious care.
Let us hasten to relieve his mind of all fears on our
Account."
</p>

<p>
Amaziah was well pleased to see his wife and Naomi
in safety.  Their long absence had alarmed him, and the
accounts which had reached him that day of the unsettled
state of the neighbourhood, made him apprehend that
danger might lurk even among the groves of Bethany,
and within sight of his own dwelling.  He desired that
henceforth Judith and her niece should confine their
rambles to the immediate vicinity of the house unless he
was able to accompany them; and knowing how greatly
they would both regret being deprived of the society of
Mary, he kindly proposed to send a letter the following
day to bring her to their own residence, where she could
remain until they returned to the city.
</p>

<p>
This plan was put into execution, and on the morrow
their venerable friend was established under their roof.
For many years Mary had not left her humble dwelling,
to which she was fondly attached.  It was but a portion
of the house in which she and her sister and Lazarus
had been wont to receive the visits of the Redeemer,
that now remained in her possession; for poverty, and
a desire for obscurity, had led her to relinquish the
greater part of the range of low buildings that
surrounded the courtyard, and to retain only two small
apartments that opened into a narrow and unfrequented
street.  But the spot was dear to her heart, and she
hoped to live and die in that once happy home.  She
had therefore hitherto declined all the requests of
Amaziah and Judith that she would spend the remainder of
her days with them; and it was only the hope of being
useful to the young convert that now induced her to
leave her obscure abode to spend some days in the
spacious and beautiful villa of her Christian friends.
</p>

<p>
"What are these marble pavements and rich furniture
to me," she observed one day to Naomi, "compared with
the ground on which my Saviour has stood, and the seat
on which he rested while I sat at his feet and listened to
his words?&mdash;and what are these lofty pillars and gilded
ceilings, compared with the rocky cave where once I
saw him stand and call my dead brother to life with a
voice of almighty power?  Nothing but the consciousness
that I have been permitted to assist you, my child,
in the path towards eternal life, and the hope of being
yet serviceable to you, could have drawn me from my
beloved retreat even for a few days."
</p>

<p>
"Have you then dwelt entirely at Bethany ever since
your brother was restored to life?" asked Naomi.
</p>

<p>
"Yes: both during the years that were added to his
mortal life, and since he descended a second time to the
grave, it has been my constant and my cherished home.
For some time after my brother's resurrection we suffered
much persecution and much alarm on his account.  The
chief priests and the Pharisees saw how many of the
people believed in Jesus after he had performed that
astonishing miracle; and as they could not deny the fact
that Lazarus had been dead and was alive again; they
sought to kill him, that by his presence and his words
he might no longer bear witness to the power of the Son
of God."
</p>

<p>
"Could they suppose," exclaimed Naomi, "that He
who had exerted that power to restore your brother to
life, would suffer his work of love and mercy to be
frustrated by their malice?  Oh! how could they themselves
refuse to believe in Him, when so undeniable a proof of
his Godhead was before their eyes!"
</p>

<p>
"Pride and ambition and self-righteousness blinded
their eyes," replied Mary.  "They looked for a triumphant,
kingly Messiah; and they would not receive the
meek and lowly Jesus, who had not even where to lay
his head, and who chose his own immediate attendants
not from among the learned, or the rich, or the holy in
their own eyes, but from among humble fishermen, and
the yet more despised class of publicans."
</p>

<p>
"It was the belief that Christ would appear in his
glory at his first advent," replied Naomi, "that so long
prevented me from fully comprehending that Jesus was
indeed the Messiah spoken of by all the prophets; and
it is the same error that causes my father and all his
pious but mistaken friends to regard the Christians as
deluded fanatics.  Our people are accustomed to consider
only those prophecies that speak of the glory and
victory of Christ, and the restoration and happiness of
our nation; and all those passages which you have
pointed out to me, as so wonderfully describing the
humility, and sufferings, and death of Jesus, are
disregarded, or supposed to relate to some other person.  It
now appears unaccountable to me, how I could so often,
in former days, have read the book of the prophet Isaiah,
and yet have doubted who was spoken of as the 'Man of
Sorrows, and acquainted with grief.'  Truly was he
'despised and rejected of men,' and truly have the Jews
'hid their faces from him.'  Oh, when will the time
come that the report of the prophets and apostles shall
be believed among God's chosen people, and the arm of
the Lord revealed to that nation who are called by his
name!"
</p>

<p>
"It is not for us to know the times or the seasons
which God hath put in his own power; but most clearly
are we told by the mouths of the prophets that God has
mercy yet in store for his people, and that at the end of
the days they shall again be restored to greater power
and greater happiness than they have ever yet enjoyed;
and then will Messiah return the second time in glory,
and then will all the majestic prophecies relating to his
reign be accomplished.  But ere that blessed time arrives
our Lord himself has told us that there shall be wars and
rumours of wars, and great tribulations and sorrows, such
as never have been yet on the earth: but he has also
told us that he that endures unto the end, the same shall
be saved."
</p>

<p>
"And do you believe, Mary, that those days of tribulation
are now coming on the earth, and that the Messiah
will shortly appear again in glory?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe, my child, that heavy judgments are about
to be inflicted on the daughter of Zion, and that those
only will escape who put their trust in the Lord Jesus.
It was his own command that his disciples should not
remain in Jerusalem when they saw these things begin
to come to pass; and at the commencement of the war
he revealed to some of his devoted servants that the days
of sorrow were coming, and that they must flee for
refuge to the city of Pella, on the other side of the river
Jordan before the city is encompassed with armies.
Many of the Christians have already removed thither,
and all my most valued friends, except Amaziah and
Judith, are among the number.  My age and obscurity
and poverty have hitherto protected me from danger and
from insult; and until I find that it is no longer safe to
remain at Bethany I am unwilling to leave my home.
My days on earth cannot be many, and if it is the will
of the Lord, I would wish to end them where I have
dwelt so long; but I must not presumptuously remain in
danger, from which my Lord and Master has warned me to
flee; and, therefore, when I find my present abode
insecure, I shall, with God's permission, follow my brethren
to Pella.  Doubtless Amaziah and Judith will remove
thither in due time, and they will permit me to
accompany them.  Would to God that you and your whole
family could be persuaded to do the same, Naomi, and
thus escape destruction."
</p>

<p>
"My father will never leave Jerusalem while one
stone stands upon another.  With his feelings and his
belief, I cannot wonder at it; and my mother would not
be separated from him to escape the greatest sufferings
or avoid the greatest dangers.  Do not, then, blame me,
dear Mary, if I resolve to remain at all hazards with my
parents.  If distresses come upon them, I can be a comfort
to them; if death be their portion, I can close their
eyes and shed tears over their remains.  And if I fall
myself, death is no longer terrible to me.  I know in
whom I believe; and I would not wish to survive my
family, and witness the desolation of our beloved, our
beautiful city."
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt, my dear Naomi, that the Lord
will make your duty clear to you when the time for
decision arrives.  At present I would have you remain
with your natural protectors, and seek by prayer, and by
every other means in your power, to promote their
happiness both spiritual and temporal.  But you must not
throw away your life: the Lord has called you to
himself, and has given you grace to believe in him to the
saving of your soul, and you must in return devote
yourself to him in spirit, soul, and body, and be willing
to serve him on earth so long, and in such a manner as
he in his wisdom shall appoint.  It is indeed a blessed
change, when the believer falls asleep, and his spirit
wings its way unfettered to the presence of his Saviour
and his God: but we must wait his time, and bless him
for every day in which we can glorify him and serve our
fellow creatures."
</p>

<p>
"That is true, Mary, and yet I often wish to die;
and I have thought, while reflecting on your brother's
being recalled to life, that it would have been better for
him to have remained in the grave.  His spirit must
have been blest, for he was the friend of Jesus; and it
seems sad for him to return to this cold world again, and
mix in its cares and its troubles, and even to dwell in it
so many years after the light of the Saviour's countenance
was removed."
</p>

<p>
"Your feeling is perhaps a natural one," replied
Mary, "but Lazarus never murmured at his rest being
delayed a few short years.  He was thankful to be
restored to us, and to be allowed again to be our comfort
and our joy; and he was thankful to be permitted to
be a witness of his Master's power, and to have the
privilege of so greatly adding to the number of his
disciples.  When again his time was fully come, most
joyfully did he resign his spirit into the hands of his
beloved Master; and then did I and my sister Martha
once again weep over his grave: but, oh! how different
were our feelings then, from those which harrowed our
souls at his first departure from us.  When the second
time he expired, which occurred only seven years ago,
we would not have recalled him to life if we could have
done so; for then we knew that his ransomed spirit had
fled to the presence of his Saviour, and there we hoped
ere long to rejoin him.  Martha followed him very
shortly, and I remained alone.  I have had many
Christian friends, and many consolations and blessings,
but nothing could restore the earthly happiness I once
enjoyed.  My heart is now in heaven, where my treasure
is; and there, through God's mercy in Jesus Christ, I
trust I shall soon meet those who have passed through
the valley of the shadow of death before me."
</p>

<p>
The conversation was interrupted by a summons for
Naomi to join her uncle and aunt, who were about to set
forth on their return to Jerusalem; and Mary also took
leave of them, and proceeded with an attendant towards
her native village.  Amaziah and his party had not gone
far on their way, when, as we have already related,
Theophilus met them with the dreadful tidings of the
arrival of the Idumeans, and they hastened back to their
secluded dwelling.  The safety of Mary was immediately
thought of, and a messenger was dispatched in pursuit of
her.  She had not reached Bethany when he overtook her;
and before Amaziah and his son left their home and
returned to Jerusalem, their aged and revered friend
was again safely lodged under their roof.  The house
was situated in a commanding position, and being
strongly built, and partially fortified since the recent
disturbances, it was looked upon as a place of sufficient
security until Amaziah could take further measures for
the removal of his family, either to his dwelling in the city,
or, if necessary, to Pella.
</p>

<p>
The events of that dreadful night and the succeeding
days have been already recorded; and when Amaziah
returned from the bloody city to his quiet home in the
mountains, he could hardly believe that such scenes were
yet going forward within so short a distance from the
peaceful spot.  But he could not conceal from himself,
that however tranquil all appeared around them, their
present abode was no longer a secure one, and he
proceeded with the greatest dispatch to make the needful
preparations for removing to Pella.  Naomi was greatly
shocked and distressed at the account which her uncle
brought of the state of her family, and of her father's
severe wounds, and consequent illness.  She would
instantly have hastened to rejoin them, and lend her aid
in nursing and cheering her beloved parents and her
friend Claudia, but it was quite impossible for her to
enter the city under the present circumstances; and
Amaziah also brought her a letter from Salome, in which
she was desired by her parents to continue under the
protection of her uncle, and to accompany him to
whatever place he might find it desirable to make his
temporary residence.
</p>

<p>
Amaziah declared his intention of retiring to Pella, as
the refuge pointed out by express revelation, where the
people of the Lord should hide themselves until this
tyranny should be overpast; and though Naomi would
gladly have encountered danger and suffering to be again
with her father and mother, she could not but rejoice in
the prospect of spending some weeks in the company of
a society of Christians, where she might observe their
manners and share their worship, and even be admitted
by baptism among the members of the true church.  The
removal to Pella was soon effected; and Mary consented
to accompany her friends, in the hope that when the
Idumean army had departed and the present violent
disturbances were quelled, she might be permitted again to
return to Bethany and end her days.
</p>

<p>
During the whole of the winter the civil war raged in
Jerusalem with unabated violence, and it was impossible
for Naomi to rejoin her family.  Occasionally Theophilus
contrived to send intelligence to Pella of the proceedings
in the city; and by his messengers Naomi received long
and affectionate letters from her parents and Claudia,
and enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing that her father's
health was restored, and that he and his family were
safe and unmolested.  How long their security might
last was very uncertain, as the robbers and assassins
became daily more powerful and more insatiable,
notwithstanding the efforts of the other party; and Naomi
trembled for her friends.  Her fervent prayers were
joined to those of her Christian brethren for the
preservation of those so dear to her, amid the destruction
that threatened them; and still more fervently did she
pray that they might be brought to the knowledge of
the Gospel, and preserved from the far more terrible
destruction which she believed was yet to come upon
her nation, and to swallow up all who wilfully despised
the grace of God in Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
Every day did that grace become more precious to
her, and her faith become more lively and more deep.
The beautiful and simple forms of worship that were
observed by the Christians powerfully affected her heart.
In the meetings of this holy band all was calm and
peaceful: tears of deep devotion and unaffected humility
stole silently down the cheeks of many a once hardened
sinner, and many a young and ardent convert, as they
knelt together in their unadorned sanctuary, and joined
in the prayers and confessions which were pronounced
by the elders of the community.  Meekly they bowed
their knees; but there were no prostrations on the
earth, no outward gestures or vehement excitement;
and their prayers were offered up with the devotion of
creatures before their Creator, the love of ransomed
sinners before their Redeemer, and the confidence of
children before a Father, who has promised, that
wheresoever two or three are gathered together in his name,
there will He be in the midst of them.  Those who had
witnessed the imposing magnificence of the temple-service,
and beheld the thronging multitudes, the glittering
gold and jewelled dresses of the priests, the costly
sacrifices, the clouds of incense, the marble pavements
and splendid altars, and listened to the brazen trumpets
and united voices of the choristers, that were ordained to
impress the senses, and fix the attention of the Jews,
might have smiled at the simplicity of this little church
in the wilderness.  Frequently they held their meetings
in the silence and the obscurity of night, and selected
some neighbouring glen or rocky recess in the mountains
as their place of worship.  There, undisturbed by
the Jews who dwelt in Pella, they united their voices in
hymns of prayer and praise, while the caverns re-echoed
the loud "Amen," and repeated the joyful "Hallelujahs"
of these poor and exiled brethren.  Naomi's soul was
lifted up with gratitude and devotion; and she felt that
this was an offering and a sacrifice more worthy of the
Redeemer, and more acceptable to him than all the blood
of bulls and goats, that were only a type of his own
complete and all-atoning sacrifice.  She ardently desired
to be received into the Christian church by baptism,
and allowed to partake in the holy communion of the
body and blood of Christ; and when she was considered
to be duly instructed in the doctrines of her newly-adopted
religion, and had satisfied the catechists and
elders that her faith was sincere and her conduct
consistent, the ceremony was performed with the same pious
simplicity that distinguished all the outward manners
and customs of the primitive Christians.  Naomi rejoiced
in being permitted thus to make an open profession of
her faith, and of her firm resolution, by the grace of God
and the help of his Spirit, to "renounce the devil and
all his works, powers, and service," and "the world, and
all its pomps and pleasures."  Her mind was fully made
up as to her future line of conduct; and much as she
dreaded her father's displeasure, she was determined, on
her return to Jerusalem, to confess to him her conversion
to Christianity, and her firm resolve to live according to
the dictates of that religion, and no longer to conform to
the rites and ceremonies of Judaism.  She knew his
violent prejudices against the religion of the Nazarenes;
and she knew how grieved and disappointed both he
and her mother would be when they found that she had
renounced the way of her fathers, and adopted the faith
which they so greatly despised.  But then she trusted to
her Saviour to support her under all trials, and carry
her through all temptations which were incurred for his
name's sake; and she felt that she could not without
hypocrisy any longer conceal her true belief, or appear
to take part in the Jewish rites and customs, that were so
strictly observed in her father's house.  She hoped also
that Zadok's fond affection for her would prevent him
from using any harsh measures; and she knew that her
mother's gentle and forgiving temper would not long
cherish anger towards her; but that she would use all
her influence with her husband, to soften his heart
towards his beloved and hitherto dutiful and obedient
daughter.  Therefore she checked her fears and her
anxieties, and strove to derive all the benefit that was
possible from the intercourse of the pious company, with
whom she was so unexpectedly and so happily permitted
to dwell.
</p>

<p>
The privilege of attending the Holy Eucharist, or
Supper of the Lord, was allowed to the young Christian
after her baptism; and she frequently and thankfully
partook of it, to the strengthening and refreshing of her
soul.  In those early days this sacrament was administered
to baptized believers on every Lord's day, and also
on many other occasions.  In some churches it was
celebrated four times a week; and it is even recorded,
that while (in the words of St. Chrysostom) "the spirit
of Christianity was yet warm and vigorous, and the
hearts of men passionately inflamed with the love of
Christ," they communicated every day; and found
themselves stronger and healthier, and more able to
encounter the fierce oppositions that were made against
them, the oftener they fed at the table of their crucified
Saviour.  Would to God that the same love of Christ
now animated the hearts of all who have been admitted
as members of his visible church!  We should not then
see his table neglected, and his command disregarded,
as now we do; and the same blessed results might be
expected.  We, like our holy fathers in the faith, should
become "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
might;" we should indeed "eat his flesh and drink
his blood," and find it to be "the food that nourishes
to salvation."
</p>

<p>
The manner of celebrating the holy sacrament in the
first days of the church differed very much from that
which we are accustomed to see, as a banquet or supper
usually preceded the administration of the consecrated
elements.  These repasts were called Agapæ, or Love-feasts;
and there rich and poor met together as equals,
and partook in common of the food which was provided
from the oblations and gifts of the communicants,
which were always bestowed, according to their respective
ability, for this purpose, and for the relief of the
poor.
</p>

<p>
In her intercourse with the Christians, Naomi could
not but observe and admire the sobriety which marked
their apparel, the temperance which they observed in
regard to their food, and the modesty and simplicity that
reigned in their whole deportment.  They were governed
by the rule of the apostle, who directed his converts,
"having food and raiment, therewith to be content;"
and while they avoided singularity and affectation, they
were careful to fall into no excess, and indulge in no
vanity or worldly pleasures.  Naomi contrasted the
jewelled tiaras, the embroidered shawls, the silken robes
and sashes fringed with pearls, the massive and highly-wrought
armlets and bracelets, the golden clasps, and all
the other dazzling ornaments and glowing colours that
then distinguished the attire of the wealthy Jews, with
the plain and sober garb of her new associates; and she
felt how much more suitable was the appearance of the
Christians to the condition of those who are but
"strangers and pilgrims on the earth," and profess to
seek a home in heaven.  All her own ornaments, with
which the indulgence of her father had liberally supplied
her, were laid aside; and she would have disposed of
them all, and given the product to her needy brethren,
had not Judith reminded her, that as the gifts of Zadok,
she had no right to part with them without his consent;
and especially for the relief of those who were in his
judgment unworthy of the air they breathed, and not to
be approached by a faithful son of Abraham without
contamination.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
</h3>

<p>
The winter passed away, and it was now the spring of
the year 68, and the commencement of a new campaign.
The Jews who had deserted, or fled for refuge to the
camp of Vespasian, earnestly besought him to march
without further delay towards the capital; but the
Roman general thought it more prudent to defer that
step until he had reduced the rest of the country.  The
first place which he attacked was Gadara, the chief
city of Peræa.  Some of the most influential inhabitants
sent a deputation to meet and conciliate Vespasian; and
the rebellious party, after revenging themselves on some
of those who had offered to surrender, withdrew from the
city, and the conqueror was received with acclamations
of joy.  A garrison was placed in Gadara, for the
protection of the inhabitants; and Vespasian having
dispatched Placidus, with five hundred horse and three
thousand foot-soldiers, to pursue the insurgents who had
fled from the city, returned to Cæsarea with the rest of
his forces.  The fugitives had taken possession of a large
village called Bethanabris, which they fortified as well
as lay in their power.  The Romans attacked them in
their place of refuge; and being unable to scale the walls
or force the gates, Placidus employed his favourite
stratagem to draw them from their hiding-place.  He
feigned a retreat; and when the Gadarenes sallied forth
to pursue his army, he faced round, and getting between
them and the gates, effectually cut off their retreat.
Before night the village was taken and destroyed, with a
dreadful slaughter.  Those of the insurgents who escaped,
fled towards Jericho, and being joined by a number of
the peasants on their way, they became a considerable
body before they reached the eastern bank of the Jordan,
near Bethabara.  Here Placidus overtook them; and the
river being much swollen, they found it impassable, and
were compelled to turn and fight.
</p>

<p>
The Romans charged with all their accustomed vigour,
and multitudes of the half-armed peasants and wearied
fugitives fell before them.  Hundreds were driven into
the rapid and foaming waters, and many plunged in of
their own accord, to escape the swords of their assailants.
The river was almost choked with bodies, and countless
numbers were carried down the stream into the Dead
Sea, and lay floating on its dark and stagnant waters.
Fifteen thousand were killed on this spot, and upwards
of two thousand taken prisoners; while an immense
number of cattle of every description were driven off as
a valuable prey, from that fertile and pastoral district.
Placidus did not immediately rejoin the main body of
the Roman army, but remained for some time in that
neighbourhood, and reduced the whole country of Persea,
and the coast of the Dead Sea, as far as Machærus.
</p>

<p>
The moon was high in the heavens, and her clear and
silver light fell softly on the bleak and barren scenery
around, and glittered on the motionless surface of the
deadly "sea of the plain."  No sound of life broke the
oppressive stillness of the night, save the footsteps of a
solitary soldier, who slowly wandered along the margin
of the lake, and gazed on the dark outline of the ruins
that yet remained near the shore, a standing witness of
the wrath of God on the sinful cities of the plain.  The
shattered remnants of walls and towers were covered
over with a coating of asphaltum or bitumen, which
preserved them from crumbling away; and the margin of
the sea was strewed with pieces of the same bituminous
substance, thrown up from the depths below, where all
the wealth and all the grandeur of Sodom and Gomorrah
lay engulfed in utter ruin.  Who has ever looked upon
the black expanse without a shudder?  Marcellus felt
that the scourge of God had passed over the spot, and
he contemplated it with intense interest.  Life was extinct
around him&mdash;no animal bounded over the sterile rocks,
no bird sank to rest in the small tufts of shrubs that
scantily covered their surface.  The low monotonous
sound of the distant Jordan, forcing its way through the
heavy waters, and the sighing of the wind among the
reeds, only added to the gloom of the scene.  Marcellus
had been disgusted that day with the cruelty and
bloodshed which he had witnessed.  He had fought like a
Roman, for glory and for victory; but he had remembered
that he was a Christian soldier, and had shown
mercy where mercy was possible.  He had endeavoured
to restrain the wanton massacre that was carried on by
his comrades; and had exposed himself to the charge of
cowardice and faint-heartedness for his humanity.  But
his conscience approved his conduct; and he rambled
from the distant camp to enjoy the silence and calm of
the night, and to commune with his own heart and with
his God in peace.  He ascended the rocky cliffs that
bounded the lake to the west, and looked over the sleeping
water, and the lower eminences on the eastern shore,
until his eye rested on the far distant towers and
fortresses of Jerusalem.  The moonlight sparkled on the
gilded pinnacles of the temple; and the clear blue sky
threw out the summits of the lofty buildings in bold
relief.  Marcellus thought that Naomi was within those
walls; and, oh, how his heart yearned to be permitted
to join her there, to share her anxieties and her dangers,
and to protect and cheer her in the coming days of
trouble and of woe!  But he was enrolled among tin
ranks of her enemies, and he must be among those who
would seek the ruin and destruction of her beloved city.
</p>

<p>
His only consolation was the hope, that when the
Roman army should actually besiege the walls of
Jerusalem, and as he doubted not, carry the city by storm,
he might have it in his power to preserve the lives of
Naomi and her family; and this hope made him rejoice,
that since he could not take part with her countrymen,
he was at length brought to the scene of action, and
should be near her, though numbered with her foes.
The fate of Jerusalem, so awfully predicted by the
Messiah, pressed heavily on his mind; for who in that day
should escape but the people of the Lord?  He knew
the bigotry of Zadok, and he feared that Naomi inherited
all his prejudices, and shared his abhorrence of the
Nazarenes.  His dear sister too, what would become of her?
Hitherto Rufus had found it impossible to have her
safely conveyed from the city to the camp, though he
had sought earnestly to find an opportunity of doing so
ever since the war had approached the neighbouring
regions; but the distracted state of the metropolis
rendered it impracticable; and if Vespasian were now to
march to the attack, Claudia must remain among the
besieged.
</p>

<p>
The reflections of Marcellus were deep and melancholy;
and almost unconsciously he wandered on, and
was descending the rocky boundary of the dismal lake,
by a path that led into a narrow valley to the east, when
he started from his reverie at the sound of footsteps,
hastily approaching towards him.  The light of the
moon was intercepted by the lofty rocks that overhung
the pathway, and Marcellus did not recognise the figure
of Javan, until the latter advanced close to him, and
presenting a drawn sword, fiercely demanded who went
there.  The voice discovered him to the young Roman,
who immediately perceived that Javan had escaped
from the camp, and was now hastening through these
unfrequented valleys, in the hope of making his way
round the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and
rejoining his countrymen in Judea.
</p>

<p>
"Is it you, Javan?" he replied; "you may sheath
your sword, for you need fear no evil from me.  But tell
me, wherefore are you here?"
</p>

<p>
"I have fled from captivity, Marcellus.  Liberty is
the right of every man, and especially of every Jew.
Had I met any other Roman in this dark glen, revenge
and self-preservation would have urged me to plunge
my sword into his bosom; but I can trust you, though a
heathen."
</p>

<p>
"I have not the power to compel you to return to the
camp," replied Marcellus; "otherwise it would be my
duty, however unwillingly, to do so.  You were on your
oath, Javan, to remain within the palisades; and to
effect your escape you must have bribed Clodius, who
had the charge of you, and broken a sacred promise.
Let me entreat you to redeem your word, and return with
me to the camp."
</p>

<p>
"What is there binding to a Jew in an oath taken to
a heathen, and that oath a compulsory one?" answered
Javan, in a tone of contempt.  "The life and liberty of
one son of Abraham are worth a hundred promises; and
the wily Romans have deserved no confidence at our
hands."
</p>

<p>
"The word of every man should be sacred," said
Marcellus; "the Almighty Jehovah heard and recorded
your promise, and in his sight you are guilty of
falsehood."
</p>

<p>
"What is the Lord of Israel to you, Marcellus? and
why do you utter his great name with so much reverence?"
asked Javan, with an involuntary feeling of awe.
</p>

<p>
"Because I have learnt to acknowledge your God as
King of kings, and Lord of lords, and to know that all
our thoughts, and words, and actions lie open before his
eye; and therefore, Javan, I should fear to be guilty of
a wilful sin against his holy laws, more than to dwell in
captivity, or even to be put to a violent death."
</p>

<p>
"If you, Marcellus, have been taught the knowledge
of the true God, yet Clodius and the rest of your comrades
are but base idolaters.  I would not break my word to a
Jew: but now I am free, and I rejoice too much in my
liberty to resign it for the sake of a promise to a Roman.
Farewell, Marcellus; I hasten to Judea; and when next
we meet, it may be at the walls of Jerusalem."
</p>

<p>
"Since you are resolved to go we will part as friends,"
replied Marcellus, extending his hand towards Javan.
who received it, though with an air of suspicion, and at
the same moment grasping his sword-hilt, to guard
against any treacherous design on the part of the Roman.
</p>

<p>
"You do not yet know me, Javan," said Marcellus:
"I trust one day we may be better acquainted.  My
sister Claudia is in your father's house; I charge you to
be a brother to her, until we can find means of conveying
her to a place of greater safety.  Bear to her my most
affectionate salutation and blessing&mdash;and to Naomi also&mdash;may
I not send the same message to her?  She lives in
my memory and in my heart as a beloved sister.  It may
be that the time will come when a friend in the Roman
camp may be of service to her and her family.  Tell her,
Javan, that Marcellus will use every influence, and brave
every danger to promote the safety and the happiness of
those whom he has loved so long."
</p>

<p>
There was something in the tone and manner of the
noble young Roman that softened even Javan's rugged
nature.  "Forgive me, that I doubted you for a moment,
Marcellus," he replied; "you were always brave and
generous, and kind; and I will bear your message to my
sister, though I fear she will value it more than will be
for her peace.  She has always regarded you more kindly
than a Jewish maiden should have done; and it will but
revive her girlish affection to hear, that amid the gaiety
and magnificence of Rome, and the toil and excitement
of a camp, you still remember her.  I hope she never
may be reduced to need the protection of any Roman;
but should such be her fate, there is not one of that
proud nation to whom I would so willingly or so
confidently consign her as to you."
</p>

<p>
With these words Javan left his friend, who watched
his dark figure as he traversed the valley, and emerged
into the bright moonlight, that rendered the open plains
as clear as in the day.  Marcellus envied him, for he was
going where Naomi dwelt; and it would be his privilege
to protect her in time of danger: but he pitied the deceit
and the pride of his heart, which could induce him to
seek safety and freedom at the expense of truth, and
regard his captors as unworthy to be treated with the
faith and confidence due from man to man, whether
friends or foes.
</p>

<p>
He returned to the camp, and found Clodius in great
dismay at the flight of Javan.  He had allowed his
prisoner more liberty than was usual, in dependence on
his promise to remain in the precincts of the camp; and
he feared the anger of the centurion, who had the
command over him.  Great power was in the hands of the
centurions; and they might chastise with blows any
offending member of their company; but only the
generals could punish with death.  Happily for Clodius,
his commander was Rufus, and he was a just and a merciful
man.  Marcellus also undertook to state the case to
his father, and persuade him to intercede with Placidus
for the pardon of the delinquent, which was at length
obtained, though such was the strictness and severity of
the Roman discipline, that but for the influence of Rufus
and his son, it is probable that Clodius might even have
forfeited his life for his negligence.
</p>

<p>
Placidus having completed the conquest of Persea,
remained in the neighbourhood of Jericho, to await the
further movements of Vespasian, who was at this time
greatly disturbed by the news which had just reached
him of the state of affairs at Rome.  Vindex had revolted
against the power of the emperor in the province of Gaul;
and Vespasian foreseeing that his army might be required
to take part in the war consequent on this rebellion, was
very desirous to hasten the operations in Palestine, and
put an end to the war without loss of time.  He marched
from Cæsarea, and successively attacked and reduced
Antipatris, Lydda, and Jamnia, and blockaded Emmaus,
which for some time resisted his forces.  But Vespasian
did not suffer this event to delay his progress; he seized
on the avenues leading to the city, fortified his camp with
a strong wall, and leaving the fifth legion to maintain the
blockade, he proceeded southwards through the toparchy
of Bethleptepha, wasting all around with fire and sword.
From thence he entered Idumea, and seized and fortified
such castles and fortresses as he found convenient for his
designs, and took also Bataris and Cephartoba, two towns
in the very heart of the country, where he put to the
sword upwards of ten thousand men, and carried away a
great number of prisoners.  In these towns he placed a
strong body of troops, and left them to overrun and
ravage all the neighbouring mountainous region.  He
himself, with the rest of his forces, returned to Emmaus,
and thence by Samaria and Neapolis to Jericho, where
he was joined by the army which had been employed in
the conquest of Persea.
</p>

<p>
Before the arrival of the Romans, a multitude of the
inhabitants fled from Jericho, and took refuge among the
mountains that bound the wilderness of Judea, on the
borders of the Dead Sea; but those who remained in the
city perished.  Vespasian found this important place
almost deserted, and his army entered it without
resistance; and gladly reposed for some time among the
fertile and lovely gardens, and the shady groves of
palm-trees that lay around the city, before they proceeded to
traverse the dreary and mountainous desert that lay
between Jericho and Jerusalem.  The plain of Jericho
is surrounded by wild and barren mountains, extending
northward as far as the country of Scythopolis and
southward towards the shores of the Dead Sea, and the great
plain of the Jordan.  This very extensive plain may be
said to reach almost the whole length of Palestine, and
to contain within its limits the two seas or lakes of
Genesareth and Asphaltites.  These lakes are united by
the Jordan; but their waters are of the most opposite
qualities, those of the former being sweet and salubrious,
while the latter gives nourishment to neither animal nor
vegetable life, but diffuses barrenness and death around
its dismal shores.
</p>

<p>
At the period when Vespasian encamped at Jericho,
it was a luxuriant and delicious spot.  A plentiful
fountain rose near the old city, and poured its copious
streams among the adjoining meadows and orchards.
Tradition related that this fountain was the same that in
the days of old was healed by the prophet Elisha, when
at the request of the men of the city, he cast salt into the
spring of the waters, and rendered them henceforth sweet
and wholesome, and the ground was no more barren.
The district that received the benefit of this fertilizing
stream was fruitful to a wonderful degree, and produced
fruits and herbs and honey of the finest quality.  The
climate also appeared to be affected by the temperature
of the water, which in winter was very warm; and the
air was so mild that though the other parts of Judea were
subject to snows, the inhabitants of Jericho were accustomed
at that season to wear only a garment of fine linen.
</p>

<p>
Here did Vespasian take up his quarters, while he sent
detachments to reduce all the neighbouring country.  He
dispatched Lucius Annius to Gerasa, with part of the
cavalry and a considerable body of foot-soldiers; and at
the first charge they took the city, and slew a thousand
of the young men.  The families were carried away
captive, and the soldiers had full license to plunder all
their goods; after which the houses were burnt, and
Lucius proceeded to the adjoining towns.
</p>

<p>
The fury of the war spread through all the mountains
as well as the plains around Jerusalem, and the
inhabitants of the metropolis were entirely blocked up.  Those
who would gladly have made their escape, and fled to the
Romans, were narrowly watched by the Zealots; and
those who had no wish to favour the conquering army
were afraid to venture forth, as their forces now invested
the city on every side.  Every day they looked out, in
the fearful expectation of seeing the golden eagles
glittering on the plain to the north, and the enemy
approaching to their very gates.
</p>

<p>
But it pleased the Almighty Disposer of all events yet
to postpone for a time the destruction of the place where
once his honour dwelt; and to allow his people a still
longer time in which they might by repentance seek to
avert their doom, and also make preparations for a more
regular and vigorous resistance.  News arrived from Rome
that Nero was slain, after he had reigned thirteen years,
and that Galba was proclaimed emperor in his stead.
Vespasian paused in his operations, and held his army
together, though inactive, that he might be ready to take
advantage of any events that should arise to open a way
for him towards the sovereignty of the Roman empire.
</p>

<p>
When the army of Vespasian had approached the
neighbourhood of Jerusalem, Zadok feared that Pella was
no longer a safe retreat for his daughter; and with some
difficulty he sent a messenger and a small band of armed
men to Amaziah, to entreat him to return with Judith
and Naomi to the city.  Amaziah put perfect faith in the
revealed promise, that the disciples of Jesus should be
safe in the refuge which had been appointed for them,
and he wished to remain there and keep his niece with
him.  But he knew that his confidence in the security
of their present abode would neither be shared nor
understood by his brother, and Naomi also was very anxious
to rejoin her family; he therefore complied with their
wishes, and immediately made arrangements for returning
to Jerusalem.  Amaziah did not, however, take Judith
or Mary with him, but they remained at Pella with her
Christian friends, until he had safely deposited Naomi in
her father's house, when he hastened back to the chosen
city, to abide there in conformity to the command of the
Lord, until Vespasian should withdraw his troops from
the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
But we must follow Naomi to her home, and tell of
her joys and her sorrows.  She was received with the
warmest affection and delight by her mother and Claudia
and old Deborah; but Zadok was at the temple at the
time when she and Amaziah entered his house.  He
was engaged in the performance of divine service, for
the form of worship was still continued whenever it was
possible, though the house of God was defiled with
blood and violence.  Naomi and the rest of the family
were seated on the housetop, enjoying the evening breeze
from the mountains, and the delicious odour of the fine
Persian roses that grew luxuriantly in rich marble vases
placed on the roof, when they heard the voice of
Zadok in the vestibule below.  How joyfully did Naomi
bound down to meet and embrace her father; and how
affectionately did Zadok receive his beloved daughter,
after her long and anxious separation from him!  But
there was a mixture of fear and sorrow in the heart of
Naomi, and she trembled with a feeling nearly allied to
self-reproach as she was folded in the arms of her father,
for she knew how soon his high opinion of her would
be changed into contempt, and perhaps even his affection
into hatred.  She had resolved to declare to him her
conversion to Christianity, and to implore his permission
to observe the customs and the sabbaths of her brethren
in the faith: but she felt that all her own courage would
be insufficient to support her through the dreaded
avowal; and she lifted up her heart in silent supplication
for grace and strength to enable her to take up the cross
and carry it after her Saviour, even if it should involve
the severest trials and domestic persecutions.  She had
requested her uncle to be present at her confession, as
she thought that his kindness and sympathy would support
her, and his influence with her father might also
soften his anger towards her.  It was likewise Amaziah's
intention to confide to his brother his own change of
religion and that of his wife, and to urge him to read
and examine for himself the records of the Christians,
and to weigh well their pretensions to truth and divine
revelation.  He hardly hoped to obtain any concession
on these points from his prejudiced but high-minded
brother; yet he could not bid him farewell, perhaps for
ever, without making one effort to enlighten his mind
and open to him the true way of salvation.
</p>

<p>
The evening meal was served, and after it was finished,
Zadok, according to his general custom, called his family
to join in prayer before they retired to rest.  The forms
he used were in strict accordance with the Jewish ritual;
but the piety and devotion to God's service which were
expressed both in the words and the manner of the
priest were such as would do honour to any Christian
worship, and Naomi joined with heart and voice in
celebrating the evening service to which she had been
accustomed from her earliest childhood.  At the same
time she felt how imperfect and how unsatisfactory were
any prayers that were not offered up in the name and
through the mediation of the Saviour of mankind, and
secretly she invoked his aid; while she concluded every
petition with the words so precious to her soul, "For
the sake of Jesus Christ, thy Son."
</p>

<p>
Her feelings were highly excited, and unconsciously
she repeated this solemn adjuration in an audible whisper,
as her father terminated the evening's devotions, and no
other voice prevented her soul-felt prayer from being
heard.  In an instant she was aware of the inadvertency;
and rising from her knees, she turned and saw the keen
eye of Zadok fixed upon her with an expression of
anxious inquiry, mingled with astonishment.  She had
intended to defer the important avowal of her faith until
the following day, and to request an audience with
Zadok, with no one present except her uncle; but now
she saw that her long-cherished secret was already
divulged.  She approached her father with faltering
steps, and sinking on her knees at his feet, she caught
the hem of his embroidered robe, and exclaimed, "Yes,
my father, I have betrayed myself sooner than I had
intended; I have called on the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ; and oh&mdash;spurn me not from you when I declare
myself to be his most unworthy disciple!"
</p>

<p>
Words could not paint the feelings that chased each
other across the expressive but stern countenance of the
priest, as this open avowal of her apostasy fell from the
quivering lips of his daughter.  Horror and amazement
held him motionless for a few moments, and strong
affection for his suppliant child restrained him from any
violent expression of anger; but all the prejudices of
his nation and all the pride of his sect repressed his
rising pity.  He looked on Naomi with an expression
of bitter disappointment and contempt; and unable to
command the grief that wrung his heart, he drew his
garment from her convulsive grasp, and would have
retired from the apartment had not Amaziah detained him.
</p>

<p>
"Zadok, my brother," he said, "leave us not thus in
anger; but hear your innocent, your most devoted
daughter, towards whom I know your spirit yearns,
though deep-rooted prejudice would prompt you to cast
her from you.  Hear me also, for I must encounter
your wrath and your scorn.  I must confess that the
faith which now animates Naomi's soul has for many
years been established in my own heart and that of my
wife, and that we have been in part God's instruments
in strengthening the same belief in your daughter's
mind.  The knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ was
imparted to her many months ago by one of hie most
enlightened and most favoured disciples; and when we
found that she believed in him as the Messiah, the Son
of the Most High God, we joyfully encouraged her, and
instructed her in the truth."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fool that I was," exclaimed Zadok, "to suffer
my treasure to be so long removed from my own care
and my own watchful guardianship!  But how could I
look for such a return from a brother's hands, for all the
love that I have ever borne towards him?  Speak not
to me, Amaziah.  Had you plunged a dagger to Naomi's
heart you would have less deeply injured me, than by
thus instilling into her guileless breast the doctrines of
the impostor of Nazareth.  Oh!  I have watched her
from her infancy with feelings of anxiety and affection
which none but a father can tell.  I have exulted in her
abilities, her graces, and still more, in her piety and zeal,
and knowledge in our holy religion; and in her dutiful
affection and gratitude I hoped to receive a rich reward
for all my care and solicitude.  But now what has she
become?  A curse and a shame to her parents&mdash;an
apostate from the only true faith&mdash;a believer in a
blasphemous creed, worse even than idolatry, founded on
impostures, invented by a malefactor, who was unable
to save himself or his followers from the punishment
which they drew on themselves by their false pretensions.
O God of Israel! avenge thy great name, and suffer not
these deluded Nazarenes to draw away thy lambs from
thy fold.  Restore my child to her religion and her
parents, and let her not be an outcast from thy people,
a disgrace to the tribe of Aaron!"
</p>

<p>
Zadok spoke with all the passionate vehemence so
characteristic of his Hebrew blood.  His hands were
clasped energetically, his eyes flashed fire, and his whole
form seemed animated with powerful emotion.  Salome
gazed alternately on him and on her stricken child,
whose head was bowed to the ground in humiliation and
sorrow, while her long black hair fell in profusion over
her neck and face, and concealed the tears which she
strove ineffectually to repress.  Her mother could not
feel the indignation that filled the breast of Zadok; she
could not forget that Naomi, however erring, was still
her only, her most beloved daughter, and she stooped to
raise her from the floor, and to whisper words of comfort.
But Naomi refused to rise.  "Oh, my mother," she
murmured, "has not my father cursed me?  Let me lie
in dust and ashes, until once more I hear his voice recall
those dreadful words, and bless his child."

<p>
"He cursed thee not, my Naomi; he only spoke in
sorrow and in anger of the sad change that has been
wrought in you.  But tell him that you will listen again
to his instructions&mdash;tell him that you will strive to shake
off and forget the errors into which you have so unhappily
been led, and he will bless you again, and joy will
yet return to our house.  I will kneel with you, my
child.  Zadok never yet denied me what I asked.  I will
plead for you, and promise for you that you will return
to the holy religion of your ancestors."
</p>

<p>
Salome's tears fell fast as she uttered these words, and
she knelt by her daughter's side before the dignified
form of her husband.  He could not see her thus abase
herself before him unmoved, nor behold the tears that
flowed down her gentle countenance without emotion.
He approached, and raised her from the ground, while
he replied in a softened tone, "For thy dear sake, Salome,
I will pardon the child for whom you plead so well.
But I only restore her to my favour, and acknowledge
her as my daughter, on the terms which you yourself
have named.  She shall promise no more to use the
name of the God of the Nazarenes, and she shall attend
to all the forms and customs of our religion, and again
receive instruction from our most holy rabbis and from
myself, on the points concerning which her faith has
been shaken.  Naomi, promise me this, and then come
back to my arms and my heart, as my own lovely and
beloved child."
</p>

<p>
Even Zadok's self-command was failing, and the
natural tenderness of his heart was ready to triumph
over the lofty calmness that usually distinguished his
manner and deportment.  His wife and Claudia, Deborah,
and all the other attendants wept aloud from sympathy
and anxiety, while Amaziah bent his eyes on Naomi,
and waited in almost breathless expectation of her
reply to the appeal of Zadok.  She had raised her face,
and shaken back her clustering hair from her pale brow
and weeping eyes, while Salome's words of kindness
were whispered in her ear, and she had sought to
interrupt her mother when she spoke of forgetting the faith
she had so lately learned.  But when Zadok addressed
her she paused in deep reverence, and waited in silence
until he called for her reply.  Then she rose from her
knees, and stood erect and self-possessed.  Her mother's
promise that she should return to the Jewish faith had
startled her, and recalled her to a sense of her duty,
and a confident reliance on the aid she had implored to
keep her firm and unshaken under every temptation and
trial.  Her countenance was as pale as death, and the
beating of her heart was almost audible, yet she spoke
firmly.
</p>

<p>
"My father, you have commanded me to renounce
the faith which I have embraced because I feel that it
is true.  Sooner could I gaze up at the noonday sun,
and say that it gives no light, than I can behold the
character of Jesus of Nazareth, and say that the glory
of the Godhead shines not therein.  My soul was dark,
my heart was hard, my spirit was proud and unhumbled,
and therefore I knew not peace; when many months ago
I met an aged disciple of Jesus Christ, and she told me
of his power and his love, and the words that he spake,
and the miracles that he wrought.  She told me how he
left his Father's throne on high, and lived with sinful
men, in poverty and affliction on earth, to teach them
how they ought to live.  And she told me how at
length he died, a sacrifice for sin and an atonement for
us sinners; and having borne his Father's wrath, and
drained the cup of sorrow that was mixed for us, how he
rose triumphant from the grave, and ascended again to
his God and our God, there to plead his death for our
forgiveness, and to prepare mansions of everlasting
peace and joy for all who truly love and serve him.
When I heard all this, my father, I felt my heart was
changed.  Could I be too grateful to him who had done
so much for me?  Could I feel proud and self-righteous
when the Son of God had died to wash away my guilt?
Could I any longer put my trust in the blood of calves
and goats to wash away my sin, when the blood of the
Messiah had been shed as a perfect oblation and
satisfaction?  I received the Lord Jesus as my God and
Saviour, and he has given rest unto my soul.  Never,
never will I forsake Him who gave himself for me!&mdash;never
will I renounce that name whereby alone I hope
to be saved!"
</p>

<p>
Naomi had gathered courage as she continued, and
ere she concluded her reply the colour had returned to
her cheek, her eyes had recovered their wonted brightness,
and her hands were clasped in an attitude of firmness
and devotion.  She was astonished at her own boldness,
and still more at the forbearance with which her father
listened to the end.  Zadok, and all who heard her,
were struck and impressed by the earnestness and
solemnity of her manner, and could not repress the
admiration that was excited by the zeal and the firmness
she displayed.  Amaziah rejoiced with thankfulness at
this evident proof that she was sustained by the grace
of God, and he felt proud in being the relative and the
instructor of the devoted creature who stood before him.
At length Zadok spoke:
</p>

<p>
"Would to God, Naomi, that all this warmth of feeling,
and this firmness of spirit, were directed in the way
of truth and reason.  Alas!  I can now only deplore
that the powers of your soul have been so misled.  My
heart is wounded within me, and I am unable to answer
you as I ought to do.  Go to your chamber, and remain
there until I either visit you to-morrow, or call for you
to listen to the teaching of Rabbi Joazer.  If you
return to your duty and your religion all shall be
forgiven; but if the delusions of the evil spirit cannot
be removed, and you still refuse to acknowledge yourself
a true daughter of Abraham, then, O my God! enable
me to act according to the spirit of thy holy
laws, and be the first to bring to judgment the
idolatrous member of my house, though my heart-strings
break in the effort!"
</p>

<p>
Zadok hurried from the room, and shutting himself
up in his private apartment, passed the night in prayer
for the soul of his child.  None of the family retired
to rest, for Salome and Claudia would not leave Naomi,
on whom they hoped their persuasions would have some
effect, and incline her more readily to obey the wishes
of her father.  Amaziah also remained with his niece,
to strengthen and support her, for her spirits sank after
the violent effort she had made; and he also entertained
a hope, that while he defended the cause of his niece,
his arguments might have some good influence in
weakening the prejudices of Salome and Claudia.  Had
Zadok been aware of the discussion that was carried
on for several hours that night, he would have put a
stop to it, nor have suffered his wife to listen to the
doctrines and the narratives so eloquently set forth
by his zealous brother.  Salome's naturally mild and
amiable disposition had always prevented her from
manifesting the same hatred and contempt for the
Nazarenes that was felt by her husband and her son.  The
malignant violence of Javan had ever inspired her with
fear and horror; and even Zadok appeared to her to
cherish sentiments at variance with true religion and
charity.  The character also of Jesus, of whom in her
childhood she had heard innumerable stories of love
and mercy, had to a certain degree impressed her heart;
and though she looked upon his assumption of Divinity
as unfounded and blasphemous, and ascribed his miracles
to the agency of evil spirits, according to the belief
of all her mistaken people, yet she could not withhold
her admiration from the holiness, and purity, and
self-devotion of his life, and that of his followers and
disciples.
</p>

<p>
The enthusiasm and determination of Amaziah and
her daughter also greatly influenced her mind, and she
respected a firmness which she felt herself incapable of
sharing.  She knew not then the all-powerful effect of
the Christian faith in giving courage and boldness to
the weakest believer; she knew not how the contemplation
of the Redeemer's love could inspire such a
corresponding feeling of gratitude and devotion, as to
banish all weakness and all regard for personal suffering,
and make death in its most terrible form less to
be dreaded than one act of unfaithfulness to Him.  Had
Zadok been a Christian, Salome would have found
no difficulty in receiving the same doctrines: but she
looked up to him as a model of wisdom, and judgment,
and piety; and when she heard him laugh to scorn the
"wild delusions of the Nazarenes," she was convinced
that he must have good reason for the contempt he
expressed, and that it was the weakness of her own
mind that inclined her to favour a system to which her
husband was so averse.  Had she looked simply to the
word of God, and studied it attentively, with prayer
for the guidance of his Spirit, and cast aside all human
dependence, doubtless her mind would have been speedily
enlightened, and she would have been spared much of
the sorrow, and doubt, and anxiety by which she was
eventually tried and afflicted.
</p>

<p>
Claudia had not so many prejudices to overcome.
She had been brought up in the belief of the existence
of a multitude of deities, and if required no great effort
for her to admit the God of Israel to a share of her
worship, when she was instructed by Naomi in the
wonders he had performed, and the manifestations he
had made of his power and goodness to his peculiar
people.  But her friend had found it much more difficult
to persuade her that all the divinities to whom she
had from her childhood been taught to pay adoration
were but senseless images, helpless and powerless.
Time and reflection, the perusal of the Scriptures, and
the prayers of Naomi, had by degrees eradicated the
errors of her youth; and the letter which she had
received from her brother, declaring his renunciation of
all the gods of the heathen, had gone far to convince
her that they were unworthy of her worship.  During
the period of Naomi's absence from Jerusalem, her time
had been passed in perfect retirement.  The state of the
city had made it necessary for females to remain as
secluded as possible, and Salome and Deborah had both
taken advantage of this season of comparative inactivity
to improve the good impressions already made by Naomi's
instructions.
</p>

<p>
At the period of which we are now speaking, Claudia
was therefore in belief a Jew.  Naomi had not ventured
to confide to her the change which was worked in
her own sentiments, for she feared that it might weaken
Claudia's newly-acquired faith in the one true God of
heaven and earth, if she knew that her young teacher
paid divine worship to Jesus of Nazareth.  Naomi waited
until she could be satisfied that her pupil had a right
understanding of the nature of Jehovah, as revealed by
himself; and then she anticipated with delight the task
of displaying to her mind the light of the Gospel, and
showing her how the same God who reigns over the
universe had manifested himself to the world in the
person of his Son&mdash;and this for the salvation and
redemption of guilty, fallen man!
</p>

<p>
The conversation of Amaziah on the night of her
return to her home, deprived her of the privilege of
being the first to declare Jesus Christ to her friend as
the Messiah, the Lord; but she saw with joy the evident
impression that was made by her uncle's arguments both
on her mother and Claudia, and earnestly she prayed
that the good seed then sown, might, by the influence
of the Holy Spirit, spring up and come to perfection,
and bear good fruit; and that it might be her blessed
privilege to help forward two beings so dear to her in
the way of eternal salvation.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
</h3>

<p>
We have mentioned that Galba had succeeded to the
throne of the Roman empire, in the room of the tyrant
Nero; and that Vespasian prudently abstained from
taking any active measures in Judea, lest he should
weaken his forces, but kept them together in readiness
for any enterprise that might seem calculated to promote
his ambitious views, and hasten the accomplishment of
the prophecy that had been pronounced by his Jewish
captive, Josephus.  Had all the inhabitants of Jerusalem
and the neighbouring country improved this season of
rest and respite from foreign war, their city might have
been better prepared to receive the assaults of the Roman
army when at length the siege was determined on; or,
better still, they might, by a timely submission, have
appeased the anger of the new emperor, whose attention
was greatly occupied by the unsettled state of affairs
in the regions nearer to the capital of the empire.
</p>

<p>
But no such salutary and prudent steps were taken
by these misguided and rebellious people, who only
turned the arms that were no longer exerted against
a foreign enemy, with greater animosity against each
other.  Simon the son of Gioras, the bloody and vindictive
Simon, added a third party to those which already
distracted the metropolis.  This scourge of his country
might rival even John of Gischala in cruelty and
ferocity, but he was not a match for him in cunning.  He
had been conspicuous in the rout of Cestius' army,
which had occurred at the beginning of the war and
since that period he had carried on a course of pillage
and violence.  He had been expelled from Acrabatana
by Ananus, and entering Masada, he had succeeded in
making himself master of the town.  His party had
gradually augmented; and having traversed the region
of Idumea with his fierce and victorious band, he at
length turned his eyes towards Jerusalem, and began
to entertain hopes that he might vanquish the two
parties that already contended for the superiority within
her walls, and himself become the leader and the chief
of all.
</p>

<p>
When his approach was known in the city, a considerable
body of the Zealots sallied forth to oppose him,
but they could not stand against his forces, and were
driven back again with discomfiture and loss.  Simon
did not, however, venture to attack the city
immediately; but apprehensive of his own strength, he
resolved on returning to subdue Idumea before he
commenced that enterprise.  He therefore placed himself at
the head of twenty thousand men, and hastened back to
the frontier.  The Idumeans speedily assembled to the
number of twenty-five thousand and leaving the rest of
their forces to guard their families and possessions from
the incursions of the robbers from Masada, they met
Simon on the borders of their territory, where a long
and doubtful contest was maintained the whole day.  It
is hard to say which party should be called the victors,
for Simon retreated to the village of Nam, which he had
previously fortified and put in a state of defence, and the
Idumeans retired to their own country.  But Simon
shortly afterwards made another incursion upon them
with a still more powerful army, and having pitched his
camp before Tekoa, he dispatched one of his associates,
named Eleazar, to persuade the garrison of the neighbouring
fortress of Herodium to surrender to him.  The
garrison were so indignant at the proposition that they
attacked Eleazar with their drawn swords, and he was
obliged to leap from the wall into the deep ditch that
surrounded it, where he died on the spot.
</p>

<p>
The Idumeans dreaded the power and the vengeance
of Simon, and they determined, if possible, to ascertain
the strength of his army before they again met him in
battle; and one of their princes, named Jacob, offered
to accomplish this object.  But he was a traitor, and
only sought the opportunity of betraying his country
into the hands of her enemy.  He went from Colures,
which was the head-quarters of the Idumeans, to the
camp of Simon, and immediately made an agreement
to assist him in reducing the whole country to his
subjection, on condition that he himself should be well
treated, and rewarded with riches and honours.  To
these terms Simon promised a ready compliance, and
having regaled him with a grand entertainment, he
dismissed him with extraordinary courtesy.  Jacob was
elated with the prospects which he saw before him; and
on returning to his countrymen, he endeavoured to alarm
them by a false account of the forces of Simon, describing
them as much more numerous than they really were.  He
afterwards tried various arts and persuasions with the
princes and the chief men, separately, to induce them
to lay down their arms, and receive Simon as their
governor; and while he was thus treacherously endeavouring
to weaken the courage and corrupt the fidelity
of his countrymen, he secretly sent to Simon, desiring
him to commence the attack, and promising that he
would disperse the Idumeans.  To effect this, as soon as
the enemy approached, he mounted his horse and pretended
to take flight, followed by those whom he had
already made his accomplices; and the rest of the army,
being seized with a panic, left their ranks and fled away
towards their homes.
</p>

<p>
Thus, almost without bloodshed, Simon entered the
country, took the ancient city of Hebron, and wasted all
the neighbourhood.  Marching from thence, he ravaged
the whole land of Idumea, and carried off all the
provisions and cattle of the wretched inhabitants.  His
army had increased to such a multitude from the number
of irregular troops who followed him, that the country
could not furnish necessaries for them; and the consequent
distress of the peasantry, added to the cruelty of
Simon, made them groan beneath the weight of their
accumulated misfortunes.  Simon's army carried desolation
wherever they turned: they burned some places,
and pulled down others; seized and destroyed whatever
fell into their hands, and trampled under-foot every
species of vegetation, so that the land became a desert,
and appeared as if it had never been cultivated.  These
proceedings against their former allies added fury to the
resentment of the Zealots, and yet they dared not meet
the destroyer in open battle; but having placed
ambuscades along the road, by which they were informed the
wife of Simon was to pass, they succeeded in carrying
her off a captive to Jerusalem, with several of her
attendants.  They hoped by these means to bring Simon
to terms, for they knew that the loss of his wife would
distract him; and therefore they expected that in order
to obtain her release he would bind himself by an
agreement that they might dictate.  But the feelings of Simon
were not to be acted upon in the manner which they
anticipated: instead of approaching their walls a humble
suppliant for the restoration of his wife, he came raging
like a wounded beast of prey.  All who ventured to
set their foot outside the gates, to gather olives in the
gardens or bring in other necessaries, were seized by
his watchful emissaries, and brought to their savage
master, who put them to death, without distinction of
age or sex, after inflicting on them unparalleled torments.
He is said to have been hardly restrained from tearing
their flesh with his teeth, so ungovernable was his fury
and vengeance.  Some of his victims he spared from death
only to inflict on them a worse punishment; for he cut off
both their hands, and in this mutilated condition sent
them back into the city, with orders to tell the leaders,
that Simon had sworn by the Almighty, that if they
did not immediately restore his wife to him, he would
break through their walls, and treat in the same barbarous
manner all who were within the city, without any
distinction.  This dreadful threat alarmed the people,
and even the Zealots.  In hope of appeasing their furious
enemy, they sent out his wife to him, on which he laid
aside his intention of an immediate slaughter, and
withdrew his army from the walls.
</p>

<p>
During the preparations for his departure, a party of
his sentinels brought into the camp a young Jew, whom
they had discovered lurking among the neighbouring
hills, and apparently watching their motions with great
anxiety.  He fled at their approach, but they pursued
and caught him, and now conducted him into the
presence of Simon as a spy.  The young man had a bold
and crafty countenance; and his appearance bespoke
that he had endured much hardship and fatigue; but
he almost trembled at the fierce aspect of the son of
Gioras, whose character was doubtless well known to
him.  Simon sternly demanded who he was, and what
had brought him so near his camp; and believing that
deceit could not, in this instance, be of any advantage to
him, Javan (for it was him) replied:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am the son of Zadok the priest, and have long
been a captive in the hands of the Romans.  With
danger and difficulty I escaped from them, when they were
encamped on the shores of the Dead Sea.  For months
I have wandered among the mountains and the deserts,
seeking vainly to find an opportunity of returning to my
native city, and rouse my countrymen to a fiercer
opposition against my hated captors.  The approach of
Vespasian so near the walls of Jerusalem long deterred me
from the attempt to gain entrance, as I dreaded falling
into the hands of any of his skirmishing parties; and
though I burned to find myself upon the battlements
of Zion, and to cast defiance at the infidels from her
proud bulwarks, yet I was forced to loiter away my time
in restless inactivity.  When Vespasian withdrew his
forces from the neighbourhood, I again approached my
native district, but was again disappointed in my object,
by finding that your valiant troops were contending
with those ruffian Zealots.  The succeeding war in
Idumea prevented me from passing through that country,
until you left it to seek vengeance for the insult offered
to you by John of Gischala and his robber band.  Then
I entered Judea by a secret path through the mountains,
and was anxiously watching for a moment of security,
that I might present myself before the gates of the city
and join her brave defenders, when I fell into the hands
of your brave men."
</p>

<p>
Simon was satisfied that the prisoner was not deceiving
him, and he replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why then did you not boldly come to me, and join
the ranks of my patriotic followers?  You might have
known that the welfare of Jerusalem is my only object;
and that I seek to rid her of her present oppressors,
that I may establish again the rules of order and good
government, and restore the neglected worship of the
temple to its former holiness and magnificence.  My
righteous efforts will doubtless be blessed with success,
and the God of battles will put to rebuke those
miscreants who now so audaciously trample on his holy
sanctuary and despise his laws."
</p>

<p>
"Most noble Simon," replied the wily Javan, "your
holy zeal finds an echo in my breast.  Had I known
the object of your enterprise, I should long ere this
have hastened to enroll myself under your victorious
banner, and have rejoiced to lend my aid to so
meritorious a purpose.  I am now ready to take an oath of
fidelity to you and your cause; and, by the blessing of
the Almighty, we shall soon triumph over the Zealots,
and restore the city of the Great King to prosperity and
peace."
</p>

<p>
Thus spoke Javan, partly actuated by a politic regard
to his own safety, and partly prompted by his fanatical
zeal and pride.  He hoped that Simon's party might
gain the ascendancy, if they once obtained a footing in
the city; and he knew enough of their leader to be
convinced that he would forward to the utmost all his
own schemes and projects, for what he called the honour
of God&mdash;by which he meant, the oppression and destruction
of all who differed from the proud, self-righteous
sect to which he belonged.  He believed that in so doing
he should promote the cause of religion, and strengthen
the party of those whom he considered as the only true
children of Abraham.  He therefore made up his mind
to attach himself to Simon, and, if possible, to gain his
confidence, and penetrate all his schemes.  Should they
succeed, he would enter Jerusalem as his follower; but
if he failed in opening her gates, either by force or by
subtlety, Javan depended on his own cunning to make
his escape from his adopted leader, and unite himself to
whichever party he should find the most congenial to his
own bigoted feelings, when he had succeeded in obtaining
an entrance into the city.
</p>

<p>
A compact was soon entered into between these two
crafty men, who both affected to conceal their own
cruel and ambitious views under the disguise of zeal for
religion.  In this profession Javan was more sincere
than Simon; he had devoted a great part of his early
life to the study of the sacred writings, and still more
sacred traditions, so profoundly reverenced by his sect;
and for the honour of these voluminous and erudite
productions, and the observance of the wearisome regulations
which they enjoined, he held it to be his duty to
consecrate his time and his strength, and even to abandon
every tie of natural affection that might interfere
with the views which he entertained.  But with the
son of Gioras, ambition and revenge were the darling
objects; and religion was little more than a cloak, under
which to exercise every violence and every cruelty that
was dictated by his own evil heart.  He once more
resolved to defer his intended attack upon Jerusalem,
and wait until the forces within the city had wasted yet
more of their strength in civil contests; and also until
he had further augmented his own army.  He therefore
retired again into Idumea, where for a considerable
time he continued his former system of pillage and
oppression.
</p>

<p>
The suspension of hostilities on the part of the
Romans, and the departure of Simon, encouraged some
of the Christians at Pella to forsake for a little time
their place of refuge, and to return to Jerusalem, either
to secure some of their effects which had been neglected
at the time of their retreat, or to see again those
members of their families who, though separated from them
in faith and in hope, were yet united to them by the
bonds of affection.  Among those who thus visited the
holy city at this time were Amaziah and Judith.  They
had come to the resolution of finally abandoning their
devoted and rebellious country, and retiring to Ephesus
with their son, who had hitherto remained in Jerusalem.
They knew that they should there find a numerous and
increasing church of Christians, and that the venerable
apostle John then dwelt there, and watched over the
spiritual welfare of his beloved brethren in Christ, with all
the affection and all the zeal that glowed in his devoted
heart.  To enjoy the privilege of his presence and his
instruction was one great motive that induced Amaziah
and his wife to select Ephesus as the place of their
retreat; and they also possessed friends and connexions
among the believers established there.  Before they
undertook so long a journey, they wished to see and to
bid farewell to their relations in Jerusalem; and they
likewise intended to make an effort for the preservation
of their dear Naomi, by endeavouring to persuade her
parents to allow her to accompany them, and remain
under their protection, until Judea should again be
restored to tranquillity.  Such a result of the war they
did not themselves anticipate; for they looked confidently
for the fulfilment of the denunciations of wrath
pronounced against their countrymen by the Lord Jesus;
and they feared that if Naomi remained in the city, she
would share the fate of its obstinate inhabitants.  Oh
how gladly would they have persuaded Zadok and Salome
also to be the companions of their exile!  But that they
knew to be a fruitless wish, so long as they despised the
name of the Redeemer, and disbelieved alike his
threatenings and his promises.
</p>

<p>
They found their niece unshaken in her faith, and
fully resolved to hold fast to the religion which she had
so boldly professed, in spite of all the sorrow which that
profession had brought upon her.  It is true that the
influence of her kind and affectionate mother had
preserved her from any severe manifestations of her father's
wrath; but all the domestic comfort and happiness
which she had so long enjoyed was gone.  Zadok no
longer regarded her with affection and pride, and no
longer delighted in conversing with her, and instructing
her in all the learning for which he was himself so
celebrated.  As much as possible he avoided seeing her,
and when they met, his countenance expressed such
deep grief and such repressed anger, that Naomi shrunk
from his presence, and in her own apartment shed
many bitter tears of sorrow, but not of weakness or
indecision.  The severest trial she had to undergo was
when at stated periods she was summoned to attend her
father and rabbi Joazer, to whom the secret of her
apostasy had been confided, and in whose learned
arguments her parents placed their only hope of her
restoration to the true faith.
</p>

<p>
Rabbi Joazer spared neither time nor pains to accomplish
this desired object; but all his tedious harangues,
and all his copious appeals to the rabbinical writings and
the traditions of the elders, only served to show to
Naomi more plainly the folly and absurdity of exalting
these human inventions above the word of God, and
made her feel more devotedly attached to the faith she
had adopted, and which she knew to be verified by
Scripture, and founded on divine revelation.  With
humility, and yet with firmness, she replied to the
assertions of the rabbi; and quoted the words of the prophets
to prove that Jesus was indeed the Christ.  Joazer
would not listen to her; he only overwhelmed and
silenced her, by long and rapid quotations from the
cumbrous volumes on which he rested his creed; and at
length dismissed her with anger and impatience to her
chamber again.
</p>

<p>
Claudia was her constant companion, and her greatest
earthly solace.  She sympathised in the afflictions of her
friend, and listened with an interest that daily increased,
to the detail of all that she had seen and heard at Pella,
and all the affecting narratives that had at first attracted
Naomi's own attention, and excited her own curiosity,
and led to her own adoption of the faith of Christ.  The
heart of Claudia was touched, and it was evident that
the work of the Spirit had commenced within her,
though it advanced but slowly, and she did not, as it
were, grasp and comprehend the doctrines that were
presented to her, with the rapidity that had characterized
Naomi's conversion.  Her less energetic disposition was
alarmed at the wonder and the novelty of the religion
that was proposed to her belief; and though in the
mythology which she had been taught in her childhood,
there were many pretended instances of the heathen
divinities dwelling with men upon the earth, yet the
history of Jesus Christ, God manifest in the flesh, was
altogether so different from these idle tales, and the
miracles which glorified his earthly life were so
astonishing and so awakening, that Claudia paused before she could
give full credence to all that her friend related to her.
</p>

<p>
Salome had repeated to her husband the substance of
the interesting discourse of Amaziah on the night of
Naomi's return; and Zadok saw plainly that an
impression had been made on her mind, which he was very
anxious to obliterate.  He therefore strictly enjoined
her never to renew the conversation with his daughter, on
the plea that it would only strengthen Naomi's unhappy
belief if she was called on to defend it; but his real
object was to preserve his wife from the contamination
of her obnoxious doctrines.  He also took every opportunity
of repeating to Salome his strongest arguments
against Christianity, and all the popular slanders that
were circulated against its Founder, and his immediate
followers.  By these means he succeeded in silencing the
voice of conviction that was beginning to make itself
heard in her breast; and the seed of the Spirit lay
dormant beneath the weight of ancient prejudice, and
mistaken reverence for the opinion of her intelligent
and upright husband.
</p>

<p>
Things were in this state when Amaziah and Judith
returned to Jerusalem.  The house in which they had
formerly dwelt when resident in the city, had been
pillaged and destroyed during the recent scenes of anarchy
and confusion; but Amaziah was a man of wealth, and
had secured sufficient property in gold and jewels to
provide for the maintenance of himself and his family,
besides allowing him to indulge in the benevolent pleasure
of ministering largely to the support and comfort of his
poorer brethren.  Zadok, somewhat unwillingly, invited
him to reside, during the short period that he intended
to remain in Jerusalem, in a portion of his own spacious
dwelling; but he never ate at the same table with his
brother or his family, and he allowed as little intercourse
as possible between the members of his own household
and the Nazarene inmates of his house.
</p>

<p>
The comparative state of security to which Jerusalem
and its vicinity were restored, by the inactivity of the
Romans, also induced the aged Mary to return to her
beloved home at Bethany, under the protection of
Amaziah, who left her in her secluded dwelling, before he
and his well-armed party descended the Mount of Olives
and entered the city.  Naomi could not rest when she
found that her venerable friend was again at Bethany
without seeking the first opportunity of going to visit
her; and as she was allowed to walk out under the
guardianship of the indulgent Deborah, she succeeded
several times in inducing her to extend their rambles to
the village, and permit her to rest awhile in Mary's
cottage.  The old nurse knew that Naomi was under
the displeasure of her father, and as she was present
on the evening when the disclosure of her sentiments
took place, she was well aware of the cause of Zadok's
anger, and therefore she could not imagine that his
daughter's visits to the aged disciple of Jesus would be
approved of by him.  Nevertheless she could not deny
her dear young mistress in anything, and by her means
Naomi enjoyed much delightful conversation with her
friend.  Perhaps the young and ardent convert would
have been more strictly in the path of duty if she had
not thus acted in opposition to the wishes of her parents;
but we are only describing a human character, liable to
sins and errors, and not a model of perfection, such as
the world has never seen but once.  Naomi believed
that she could not be wrong in seeking the society of
her to whom she owed the knowledge of salvation, and
endeavouring to obtain from her instructions fresh
knowledge and fresh strength, to support her in any coming
trials or sufferings.  The increasing infirmities of her
beloved teacher also acted as a strong stimulus to her to
seize every opportunity of visiting her, not only that
she might benefit by her discourse as much as possible,
but also that she might cheer her solitude, and minister
to her wants, and, as far as lay in her power, render her
latter days easy and comfortable.
</p>

<p>
Claudia always accompanied her friend on these
expeditions; and the words of the venerable and evidently
declining saint powerfully strengthened the impression
which had already been made on her mind.  The sacred
peace and joy that shone in the countenance of Mary,
riveted her attention and commanded her respect; while
the kindness and benignity of her manner, her zeal for
the spiritual welfare of her young pupils, and her tender
indulgence for their faults and backslidings, won her
warmest affection.
</p>

<p>
Judith and Amaziah also made frequent visits to the
dwelling of Mary; and by their care, a poor Christian
woman was discovered in the village, and engaged to
attend upon her, and provide for her comfort.  Hannah
was a humble but most devoted disciple, and she joyfully
undertook to watch the declining days of one so holy
and so privileged as Mary of Bethany.  Her own
poverty had prevented her from retiring to Pella at the
commencement of the war, and the entire seclusion in
which she lived, had caused her to be overlooked by
those who would willingly have assisted her; and she
now rejoiced that she had been appointed to remain in
danger and distress, since it was her lot at length to
share the dwelling, and listen to the discourse, of her who
had sat at the feet of Jesus, and heard from his own lips
the words of grace and salvation.
</p>

<p>
One evening near the time of sunset, Naomi and
Claudia were returning from their favourite walk to
Bethany, attended only by the faithful Deborah,
Theophilus, who was their frequent companion, being unable
to join them.  They crossed the rippling stream of
Cedron, and entered the garden of Zadok, which extended
from the margin of the brook to the road by which
they always approached the city gate.  The thick foliage
of the overhanging trees cast a deep shade across the
garden path, and the young maidens were startled at
observing the figure of a man lurking in one of the darkest
spots.  Claudia would have fled from the garden, and
Deborah shrunk back, trembling more from a superstitious
fear of meeting an apparition than from any apprehension
of danger from a living man.  But Naomi, with
her usual presence of mind and undaunted spirit, drew
them forward, whispering, "Fear not: if evil is intended
it is useless to fly, for we must be overtaken; and if we
boldly proceed, our confidence may deter the intruder
from approaching us."
</p>

<p>
They advanced along the most open path, and Naomi
continued talking to her companions in a cheerful tone
of voice, when even her courage was almost put to
flight by the stranger suddenly springing towards her
through the bushes, and catching her in his arms.  But
what was her surprise and delight when she heard the
voice of Javan exclaim,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is my own dear sister Naomi!  I thought I
could not mistake your form and step&mdash;but your voice
completely satisfied me.  I have been lingering here for
some hours; for I was anxious, if possible, to see some
member of my father's household, and learn the present
state of the city before I presented myself at the gate.
But as I find you, Naomi, walking thus slenderly
attended, I conclude that the civil war has somewhat
subsided, and I may fearlessly enter the city under your
escort."
</p>

<p>
Naomi most joyfully embraced her brother, for whom
she had a sincere affection, notwithstanding the many
annoyances and provocations which she had received
for his violent temper.  Indeed all these were forgotten
and forgiven during his long absence; and she
remembered but that Javan was her only brother, who had
been in danger and in captivity, and had now returned
to be her friend and companion, and the comfort, as she
hoped, of her parents.  She assured him that he could
safely enter the walls of Jerusalem, as the Zealots were
almost constantly shut up in the temple, except when
they sallied forth to insult or pillage the more peaceable
inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
"But happily," she added, "the situation of our
father's house, so near the water-gate, allows me to walk
out constantly in this direction; and not only to enjoy
the beauty and fragrance of our own garden, but to
ramble unmolested among the olive-groves of yonder
mount, and to visit the lovely village of Bethany."
</p>

<p>
Naomi sighed as she spoke of Bethany, for she feared
that the return of her brother might put a stop to the
happy and interesting hours which she passed there
with Mary; for she knew that if he once suspected the
object of her visits to the village, his anger would be
ungovernable, and she dreaded his becoming acquainted
with what he would call her impious apostasy.  She
could have wished that he might remain ignorant of it,
but she felt that it was almost a hopeless wish, and
she only prayed that she might be supported under the
bitter addition of a brother's anger and a brother's
scorn.
</p>

<p>
Claudia did not receive the salutations of Javan with
unmixed pleasure.  She feared for Naomi, and she feared
for herself, and she felt a gloomy foreboding that his
presence would only bring fresh trouble and discord.
But Deborah was overpowered with delight at again
beholding her beloved young master in freedom.  All
the waywardness of his disposition had not weakened
her attachment to him, and he returned her affection
with great sincerity.  Javan was not devoid of good
natural feelings, and when they were called forth he
displayed a warmth of heart that would have made him
amiable and beloved, if it had been united to the Christian
graces of humility and charity.  But pride and fanaticism
were his predominant passions, and too often stifled or
concealed all that was good and estimable in his character.
He loved his parents and he loved his sister.  His
father's learning and strict attention to the observances
of religion and the customs of his sect, were with him a
source of pride, and he could not but respect the deep
piety and integrity of Zadok; while his mother's gentle
and affectionate manner, and the tender admonitions
which she had bestowed on him at parting, had made
an impression on his heart that could not be obliterated.
In the energy and determination of Naomi's character
he found a counterpart of his own; and he admired her
spirit, though it had been the frequent cause of dissensions
between them in former days, while yet his sister's
heart was unchanged, and the faults of her education
were uncorrected by the mild spirit of Christianity.
But all the more engaging points in her character were
unshared by her brother, and found no sympathy from
him when his love for her was opposed by his prejudices
or his passions.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the threshold of their father's house,
Naomi hastened forward to acquaint her mother of
Javan's return, for she feared that the sudden joy of
seeing him so unexpectedly might overpower her.  She
found Salome and Zadok, with their friend Rabbi Joazer,
sitting on the terrace at the back of the house, from
whence there was a fine view of the Mount of Olives
and the surrounding country.  The situation of Zadok's
house was very elevated; and this terrace, which was a
favourite resort of the family, entirely commanded the
city walls to the east, and afforded a cool and pleasant
retreat when the sun was sinking towards the western
horizon, and casting the deep and broad shadows of the
temple and the battlements across the fertile valley that
lay below.  A small but richly cultivated garden of
flowers had been formed at the foot of the terrace, and
the perfume of roses and jessamines, and other odorous
plants, rose deliciously in the evening breeze.  The
moon had just risen above the summit of the Mount of
Olives, and though it yet appeared but as a brilliant
crescent, yet in the pure atmosphere of that favoured
land its mild beams were sufficient to shed a soft and
lovely light on all around.  Naomi paused involuntarily
when she drew near the group who were seated in this
enchanting spot.  Zadok and Joazer were conversing so
earnestly that her light step was unperceived, as the
faces of the speakers were turned from her, and
unintentionally she heard some words of their discourse.
</p>

<p>
"She is an obstinate apostate!" exclaimed the rabbi,
with warmth.  "She is unworthy of the name of Zadok's
daughter!  Let her be <i>anathema maranatha</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! say not so," cried the trembling voice of Salome.
"Curse not my child, most holy rabbi.  If, as you say,
she is possessed by the spirits of evil, let us rather pray
for her."
</p>

<p>
Zadok was about to reply, when a sigh that burst
from Naomi's burdened heart attracted the attention of
her parents and the rabbi, and they turned towards her.
It must have been a heart of stone that could look upon
her at that moment, and not be touched by the expression
of deep grief and patient resignation depicted in
her pale countenance.  Her hands were clasped, and her
glistening eyes turned upwards, as if seeking from above
that comfort and that protection which it seemed
probable would soon be denied her on earth.  Anxiety and
sorrow had already left their traces on her form and face,
and quenched the brilliance of her clear black eye; but
she was more lovely and more interesting in her patient
grief than she had been in the pride of her joyous
youth.
</p>

<p>
A tear rolled down Salome's cheek as she gazed upon
her beloved, but, as she believed, her deluded and erring
child; and Zadok turned away, and strove to conquer
the love and the compassion that swelled within his
breast.  But the rabbi was unmoved.  Years of laborious
and unprofitable study had extinguished his social
affections, and dried up the current of his natural feelings.
In the firmness of the young Christian he saw nothing
but the machinations of Satan, and in her touching
sorrow he only recognised the wiles of the evil one to
soften and deceive her parents.
</p>

<p>
"Away, thou child of the devil!" he exclaimed, "and
seek not to move your too indulgent parents by this vain
show of sorrow, while by your perverseness and impiety
you are all the while breaking their hearts.  Oh that you
resembled your holy and zealous brother Javan!  Then
would you be a joy and a comfort to the house of the
righteous Zadok, instead of bringing shame and
dishonour on the descendant of Aaron, the saint of the
Lord.  But why do I waste my words on one so obdurate
and so unworthy.  Satan hath blinded thine eyes, and
shut out the light of heaven; and but for your mother's
false tenderness, you should be sent forth an outcast, as
his portion."
</p>

<p>
To this passionate malediction the unhappy Naomi
made no reply.  She felt that it was but a portion of
her appointed trial, and in her heart she repeated the
meek words of the fugitive King of Israel&mdash;"Let him
curse, for the Lord hath bidden him."  She turned
towards her mother, and said in a faltering voice,
</p>

<p>
"I come only to announce my brother's safe return.
He feared to startle you if he suddenly appeared.  May
he be a blessing to you.  For myself, I can only expect
his scorn and hatred when he hears that I have learned
to honour the holy name which he despises.  But be it
so.  My proud heart has need of all this to convince it
of its own weakness and its own depravity."
</p>

<p>
Joazer had not waited for the conclusion of Naomi's
sentence, but had hurried from the terrace to meet and
to welcome his former pupil; and Salome seized the
opportunity of his absence to entreat her husband to
conceal from Javan, at least for a time, the apostasy of his
sister.
</p>

<p>
"Doubtless," she urged, "our prayers and our arguments
will, ere long, bring her back into the path of
truth; and you know, Zadok, the violence of Javan's
feelings with regard to the Nazarene faith.  Before I
go to meet my son, let me hear you promise to keep
from him the knowledge of what would so deeply grieve
him."
</p>

<p>
Zadok gave the promise which she required, for he
hoped that Naomi might derive benefit from the
conversation and the learning of her brother; and he knew
that if Javan even suspected her of being a disciple of
Jesus of Nazareth, he would hold it to be contamination
to have any intercourse with her.  Naomi rejoiced in
this concession, for she dreaded her brother's wrath; and
she determined that she would not confess to him her
faith so long as duty and sincerity did not require it.
She would gladly have retired to her own chamber, and
related to Claudia all that had occurred, but she felt that
her absence from the family circle on this occasion would
excite the surprise and call forth the inquiries of her
brother; she therefore endeavoured to subdue her emotion,
and to assume a cheerful aspect, before Javan and
the rabbi, joined by her father and mother, appeared on
the terrace.
</p>

<p>
The greetings and the animated conversation that ensued,
allowed her time to rally her spirits and regain her
composure.  Javan had much to tell of his perils at
Jotapata, of his long and irksome captivity, and of his
escape and subsequent adventures.  And as the name of
Marcellus was frequently mentioned in his narrative,
and Javan also faithfully delivered the parting messages
of their former friend to each member of the family,
Naomi felt so deep an interest in the discourse as to
forget for a time her own peculiar trials and sorrows.
Claudia also was delighted at the news of her brother's
safety and prosperity.  It was a long time since he had
been able to send her any intelligence; but in his last
letter he had informed him that their father was
anxiously awaiting any favourable opportunity for
recalling her from Jerusalem, and placing her in some
secure retreat, before the Roman army should
commence a serious attack upon the capital.  She had
therefore, since the departure of Simon and his army,
been in constant expectation of receiving a summons
from Rufus, and an intimation of the plan which he
wished her to pursue in order to join him.  She ardently
desired again to see her father and brother; and yet she
dreaded this summons, for her heart was linked to
Jerusalem by many ties, and she regretted that she had not
been born a Jewish maiden, that so her duty as well as
her affections might lead her to share the dangers and
remain to sympathise in the sorrows of her friends.  She
had prospects of happiness laid out before her, the
particulars of which shall be detailed hereafter, but she
feared that her father's consent might not be obtained
for their accomplishment, and that he might demand
from her a sacrifice that she felt she could hardly make.
</p>

<p>
When first she recognised Javan in the garden, she
thought that he might have been employed by her father
to escort her out of the city to meet him in some safe
place; and she listened with mingled anxiety and fear,
until she found from his conversation with Naomi that
he had escaped as a fugitive from the Roman camp, and
not come as an emissary from the centurion.  And when
she heard the story of his wanderings, and knew how
long a period had elapsed since he left the camp, though
relieved from the dread of being recalled from Jerusalem,
she again felt anxious and surprised at her brother's
long silence, and feared that his messengers must have
been unfaithful, or that his letters had been intercepted
by the way.  While she was minutely interrogating
Javan concerning her father and brother, Zadok drew
the rabbi aside, and communicated to him his reasons
for consenting to keep secret from the zealous young
Pharisee the fact of his sister's conversion to Christianity
and with some difficulty he obtained Joazer's concurrence
to the plan.  The fanatical rabbi burned to disclose
the whole story of Naomi's crimes to her brother; for
he fully anticipated that he should then have Javan's
support and assistance in bringing about those harsh
measures which he had vainly pressed upon her parents,
as most likely to conduce to her restoration.  It was
therefore with a bad grace that he agreed to allow a
further period for the trial of gentle treatment, and
consented to meet and converse with the delinquent, in the
presence of her brother, with the same freedom and
cordiality that had marked his manner towards her in
former days.  These two learned but mistaken men then
rejoined the party, and listened with considerable
interest to Javan's account of the forces and discipline of
the Roman army, and also to as much as he thought
proper to disclose of Simon's projects.  He had left his
adopted leader in Idumea, and had entered Jerusalem
as a spy upon the Zealot party.  His design was to
incline as many of the influential men as he could induce
to listen to him, to invite Simon into the city, and make
him their chief, in opposition to John of Gischala, and
when he considered affairs in a proper state for the
appearance of the son of Gioras at the gates of Jerusalem,
he had promised to send him intelligence by a trusty
messenger, or himself to go into Idumea, and summon
him to be the deliverer of his country.
</p>

<p>
The greater part of these schemes Javan kept profoundly
secret; and after he had lauded the courage and
the zeal of Simon, and expatiated on his patriotism and
his fitness to take the command of the Jewish forces, as
successor to the captive Josephus, he turned the conversation
to his own personal adventures and dangers, since
he had escaped from the Roman camp.  His sufferings
and privations had frequently been very severe, as he
was compelled to lurk among rocks and uninhabited
wildernesses for several days together, for fear of falling
into the hands of his enemies.  In the village of Bethezob,
in Peræa, he had found a refuge for some time, at the
dwelling of Mary, the daughter of Eleazar, who was a
near relation of his mother's, and with whom he had
become acquainted during her temporary residence in
Jerusalem some years before.  She was a woman of
great wealth, and lived on the estates which she had
inherited from her father, in a style of magnificence and
luxury.  Her attendants and domestics formed a numerous
retinue; and her influence in the neighbourhood
was so great, that when Placidus, shortly after Javan's
visit to his relative, ravaged the district of Peræa, he
deemed it prudent to leave the noble lady unmolested, in
the hope that his moderation might induce her to favour
the Roman party.
</p>

<p>
Javan informed his parents that he had endeavoured
to persuade Mary to remove, with her only child and
all her movable wealth, to the metropolis for security,
before the Roman army should enter Peræa; but she
had refused to do so at that time, as she felt convinced
that with the comparatively small body of troops which
Placidus had under his command, he would not attempt
the subjugation of the province.  Her conjectures had
proved false, and the Roman general had not long
afterwards carried his conquering arms through the whole
region.  Mary had however remained in safety on her
own territory; and when, some time subsequent to his
first visit, Javan had again found it necessary to retreat
to Peræa, to avoid the wild bands who, under their
leader Simon, were ravaging Idumea, he found her
meadows and orchards as fertile and uninjured as when
he saw them before the descent of Placidus.  The lady
of Bethezob had, however, been so much alarmed at the
destruction which the Romans had effected in the
surrounding country, that she told Javan she had resolved
to abandon her estates and retire with her family into
Jerusalem, to await in the security of its walls and
battlements, the termination of the war.  Better had it been
for the wealthy daughter of Eleazar to have remained
near her native village, subject to all the chances and
the dangers of an invading army, than to join the
inhabitants of Zion, and share in all the sorrows and
sufferings and revolting crimes to which the long-protracted
siege at length drove this most desperate and enduring
people!

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
</h3>

<p>
The return of Javan to the home of his father put an
end, in a great degree, to the freedom and independence
that Naomi had hitherto enjoyed in directing her
rambles according to her own inclination.  Her brother
constantly offered to be her companion and protector,
when he was not engaged in carrying on his secret
machinations in favour of Simon, and it was therefore
but seldom that she could now find an opportunity of
visiting her beloved old friend at Bethany.  Occasionally,
however, she enjoyed that satisfaction, accompanied by
Claudia and escorted by her cousin Theophilus.  Since
her return to Jerusalem from Pella, she had become
better acquainted with her cousin than she had been
before.  He was naturally extremely reserved in his
manner, and the consciousness that on the important
subject of religion he differed from the family of Zadok,
had made him rather shun his relatives, when he was
not called upon by duty or kindness to associate with
them.  It has been mentioned that during the time of
Zadok's illness, when the Zealots carried on their wildest
outrages, Theophilus remained in Jerusalem to be a
comfort and protection to Salome and Claudia.  To the
former he had always been very much attached, for the
gentleness and meekness of her disposition accorded
with his ideas of what was becoming in a female
character much more than the energetic spirit of her
daughter; and he frequently lamented that she should
remain ignorant of the religion of Him who was
eminently "meek and lowly of heart," and whose doctrines
he felt sure would have found a suitable abode in her
amiable and pious spirit.  But "the Lord seeth not as
man seeth," and judgeth not as man judgeth.  The
proud and self-confident Naomi became, by the teaching
of His Spirit, a mild disciple of Christ&mdash;she whom
Theophilus regarded as too high-minded and self-willed
to receive the humbling doctrines of Christianity, had
already embraced them with eagerness and sincerity;
but her more gentle mother shunned and dreaded the
same doctrines, and while appealing to the mercy of
God, yet put confidence in the flesh, and&mdash;as she had
been brought up to do&mdash;trusted in part to her own works
for acceptance with Him.
</p>

<p>
For Claudia Theophilus conceived a much warmer
affection.  The candour of her disposition, and her
openness to conviction when he conversed with her on the
folly and iniquity of her former religion, won his esteem;
and the intelligence and seriousness of her remarks made
him hope that in due time her heart would be prepared
for the reception of that faith to which he was a most
zealous convert.  He delighted to read and explain to
her the writings of Moses and the prophets, and to point
out to her, through the whole series of sacred Scripture,
the promise of the great Messiah, the seed of the woman
who should bruise the serpent's head.  He did not
altogether dwell on these glorious passages which depict
his triumphant advent.  He had learned to believe and
adore him in his humiliation, and he showed to Claudia
how the Saviour must be stricken and smitten, and bear
the transgressions of men; and how he must be despised
and rejected by those whom he came to save; and at
last, how it was written of him that he should make "his
grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death,"
though "he had done no violence, neither was any deceit
in his mouth."
</p>

<p>
By these means he opened her mind to the real character
of the Messiah, whose coming she still regarded
as future, and prepared her to receive the lowly Jesus of
Nazareth as "him of whom Moses and the prophets did
speak."  When Naomi returned home, Theophilus had
not further enlightened his young pupil in the Christian
faith.  He was well satisfied with the progress she was
making under his instruction and that of Salome and
Deborah; but when at their next meeting she informed
him of the confession which her friend had so boldly
made, and with tears entreated him to try and convince
her of her error, and thus restore her to her father's
favour, he felt that he could no longer dissemble his own
faith.  Amaziah, in declaring himself and Judith to be
Christians, had not mentioned his son; he had wished
him to act as he saw best for himself; and Claudia had
no idea that her preceptor was also a Nazarene, and that
he had hitherto purposely withheld from her the knowledge
of his being so.  She was therefore not a little
astonished at his declaration that he had been baptized
into the church of Christ many years ago, and that the
dearest wish of his heart was to see her as sincere a
believer in the crucified Jesus as he was himself.
</p>

<p>
From that time Theophilus took every opportunity of
conversing with Claudia on the subject most interesting
to him; and Naomi rejoiced to find that her friend's
prejudices against Christianity were gradually
disappearing.  She delighted to join in the animated
discussions that frequently occurred between Claudia and her
young teacher, and her own fervent enthusiasm inspired
fresh zeal into the calm but devoted spirit of Theophilus.
The same faith animated them both, and perfect confidence
was soon established between the cousins, such
as they had never felt in former days.  Naomi was
regarded by Theophilus as a sister; and the warmest
efforts and the most heartfelt prayers were exerted by
these Christian relatives for the advancement of Claudia's
true happiness and eternal salvation.
</p>

<p>
When Amaziah and Judith became inmates in the
house of Zadok, they saw with much concern the evident
attachment that subsisted between their son and the
young Roman maiden; for they knew not that the Spirit
of the Lord was working in her heart, and bringing her
out of heathen darkness into the glorious light of the
Gospel.  But when Theophilus informed them of the
progress which the true religion had already made in
dispelling the errors of her education, and bringing her
to the knowledge of God, they rejoiced that he had
bestowed his affections on one so amiable and so sensible
as Claudia.  The interest which they would naturally
have felt in instructing so engaging and ingenuous a
pupil, was greatly enhanced by the prospect of her
becoming ere long their daughter; and they resolved that
as soon as she was prepared to embrace the religion of
Jesus, and to receive baptism, they would solicit her
father's consent to her union with Theophilus, and
removal with them to Ephesus.
</p>

<p>
Naomi sincerely rejoiced in her friend's happiness;
but the idea that the time was drawing near when
Amaziah and Judith were to depart from Jerusalem, and that
then Claudia also would be removed far away from her,
and she should be left without one Christian friend in
whom she could confide, filled her with sorrow.  While
Mary of Bethany lived, she knew that she should not
want either sympathy or counsel; but she saw that the
aged saint was sinking gradually into the grave, and her
own prospects were cheerless and gloomy as regarded
the present world.  Nevertheless all the persuasions and
arguments of Claudia and her relatives were quite
unavailing to induce her to accompany them in their
exile.  Her parents would have consented to her doing
so, for Zadok saw how hopeless it was that she would
ever return to the faith of her fathers; and he would
not have opposed any plan by which the dishonour of
her apostasy might have been kept from the knowledge
of the world.  To Salome the loss of her daughter's
society would have been irreparable and severe; and
yet she almost entreated her to go.  She believed that
Naomi would thus be removed from many griefs and
much anxiety; and she also dreaded the evil days that
her heart foreboded were coming on Zion, and desired to
know that her beloved child was placed beyond the
reach of Judea's chastisement.  Not even her mother's
wishes could in this instance shake the resolution of
Naomi: she could not believe that it was her duty to
forsake her father and mother, so long as she was not
absolutely prevented from exercising her own religion,
and compelled to conform to anything which her
conscience condemned.  This was not the case, for Zadok
was too wise to resort to such measures; and in the
privacy of her own chamber she was permitted to pass
her time according to the dictates of her own unalterable
faith, and the customs which she had learned from
her Christian brethren at Pella.  No prospects of
personal security and happiness could tempt her to leave
her parents, more especially in a time of danger and
anxiety; and her firmness on this point moved the
heart of Zadok towards his daughter, and made him
in some measure relax from the sternness of manner
which he had assumed towards her ever since her return
from Pella.
</p>

<p>
Javan knew not that his uncle and Judith were members
of the sect which he so greatly despised.  Their
apostasy had been hitherto kept secret from him; and
therefore if he had believed that heavy calamities were
coming on the city of his pride, he would have urged
his sister to remove for a time to Ephesus.  But Javan
dreamt only of his country's triumph, and admitted not
one thought of her desolation.  He looked forward with
hope and confidence to the result of the war, and exulted
in the prospect of meeting the Romans, hand to hand,
before the walls of Jerusalem.  Therefore he encouraged
Naomi to remain, and witness the glorious deliverance
which the Lord would bring about for his own people;
and though far from sharing his triumphant expectations,
she was well pleased that he did not oppose her
wishes, and her determination to share whatever peril
should betide her parents.
</p>

<p>
The family of Zadok were thus circumstanced and
thus influenced, when, on a calm and lovely evening,
Theophilus, with his cousin and Claudia, crossed the
brook of Kedron, and ascended the Mount of Olives.
Theophilus led his companions a little out of the direct
road to Bethany, that they might visit the garden of
Gethsemane&mdash;that spot so sacred and so dear to every
one who bears the name of Him, who beneath those
aged trees wept and agonized for them!  Tradition had
preserved the situation of the very spot on which the
Saviour knelt; and in deep emotion the three young
converts now stood round the consecrated spot, while
Theophilus fervently prayed that they all might be
partakers in the redemption purchased by the mysterious
sufferings of the Son of God.  Naomi had not visited
that garden since she had been taught to feel so deep an
interest in the Divine Being, whose presence had so
frequently hallowed it, and who loved to retire to the
calmness of its peaceful shades, after the toils and trials
of the day were over.  There had he conversed with his
highly-favoured disciples, and there had he passed hours
in prayer for them, and for all who should in after ages
believe on Him through their word.  How precious was
the remembrance of those prayers to the heart of Naomi.
She had already met with difficulties and temptations in
her Christian course, and she had reason to anticipate
still further trials and sufferings; yet she knew that
she might apply to herself the words of her Lord
to Peter, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail
not;" and trusting to his intercession, she believed
that strength would be given her to take up the
cross, and follow the Lamb whithersoever he should
lead her.
</p>

<p>
Her reflections therefore on her future prospects were
serious, but not desponding; and they occupied her
mind during the remainder of the walk to Bethany so
entirely that she took no part in the conversation of
Theophilus and Claudia.  Their discourse naturally
turned from Gethsemane to the succeeding events in
the sorrowful life of the Redeemer; and when they
reached the dwelling of Mary, the interesting subject
was unfinished.
</p>

<p>
"Mary," said Claudia, as she seated herself by the
couch on which the aged disciple rested, "we have been
to the garden of Olives, where you used to say you
would lead me and Naomi, and tell us of the latter
days of Jesus of Nazareth.  I fear your feeble limbs
will never again carry you to the holy spot; but will
you not relate to us now what you remember of the
Redeemer's last visits to this house, and all the sad events
that closed his life?"
</p>

<p>
"My child," replied Mary, "it is now my happiness
and my support to dwell on those days; though when
they were present, I believed that the misery and woe
which I endured would have broken my heart.  My
soul, now that it is about to quit this earthly scene and
appear before its Maker, rests wholly on those sufferings
of my Lord and Saviour for the expiation of the sins that
crowd on my memory, and would press so heavily and
so hopelessly on my conscience, had he not borne their
weight and endured their punishment.  Not one word or
look of my blessed Master has escaped my memory.  Oh,
his countenance was light, and his voice brought peace
and joy to all who loved him as I loved him!  And yet
I lived to hear that voice lifted up in anguish, and to
see that heavenly countenance grow cold in death!  It
is to that last awful period that my own soul clings; but
I will tell you of the days of anxious grief that went
before.  It was on the evening of the last sabbath before
the Passover that Jesus came to dwell beneath our roof.
We did not know all that should befall him ere the
close of that great festival; but we saw that his
disciples were filled with grief and anxiety, and we heard
from them of the sad announcement which he had made
of his approaching sufferings; and our hearts were
heavy.  The Lord graciously accepted the invitation of
one of his disciples named Simon, who dwelt in Bethany,
to sup in his house, and it was the happy privilege of my
sister and myself to wait upon him."
</p>

<p>
"And it was on that occasion, dear mother," interrupted
Naomi, "that Judith has told me you anointed
the feet of the Lord, and wiped them with your hair, and
that he so kindly received that mark of devotion, and so
remarkably commended it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my dear Naomi, it did please the gracious
Redeemer to manifest his approbation of so slight and
unworthy a service, to teach his followers, in all ages,
that he will accept the humblest offering of the meanest
disciple, if brought to him in love and gratitude.  He who
so soon afterwards threw aside the cloak of hypocrisy,
and was known as the traitor, reproved me for thus
expending what might have been sold for a large sum,
and given to the poor; but the Lord silenced him, and
gave this melancholy sanction to what I had done: 'She
is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.'  Then
we knew that all our worst fears were well
founded, and that our beloved Master was indeed about
to leave us; and then did every moment of his presence
become, if possible, doubly precious to us all.  The
following day he remained with us here; and the report
having reached the city that he was abiding at Bethany,
multitudes of Jews came out to see him, and also to
behold our brother who had been dead, and was alive
again.  The approach of the Passover had necessarily
brought great numbers of Jews from distant places to
keep the feast; and many of these had never seen Jesus,
though his fame was spread abroad over all the land,
and they had heard of the miracles which he had
wrought, and were eager to be convinced of the truth
of the resurrection of Lazarus.  How rejoiced were we
that our beloved brother should thus become a
convincing proof of the divinity of our Lord and Master!
And the time of his departure being now so near, he no
longer refused to be publicly acknowledged.  The hour
was coming in which the Son of Man should be glorified;
and the next day he sent two of his disciples before him
to Jerusalem, to bring him the ass on which the prophet
had foretold that he, the King of Zion, should enter the
city.  Seated on that lowly animal, and surrounded by
all the inhabitants of Bethany, he descended the Mount
of Olives.  A vast concourse of persons from Jerusalem
met him as he proceeded, and while they waved aloft
the palm-branches which they had gathered, and cast
their garments on the road before him, they raised the
exulting cry, 'Hosanna! blessed is the King of Israel,
that cometh in the name of the Lord!'  O my children,
that was a glorious sight!  In the triumphant feelings
of that moment we forgot the anxiety and fear that had
so heavily oppressed our hearts.  But when we turned
to look on Him who was the object of all this
enthusiastic feeling, we saw that he took no part in the
general rejoicing.  His eyes were fixed in sorrow and
pity on the magnificent city towards which he was
approaching, and the measure of whose guilt he knew
would so soon be filled up.  The shouts of the countless
multitude were hushed, for the King of Zion opened his
lips to speak; and while tears of compassion flowed from
his eyes, he uttered that awful prediction, which doubtless
will ere long be terribly fulfilled.  Never can those
words be forgotten:&mdash;'If thou hadst known, even thou,
at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto
thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.  For
the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall
cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and
keep thee on every side, and shall lay thee even with
the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall
not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou
knewest not the time of thy visitation.'  My dear young
friends," continued Mary, in a voice trembling with
emotion, "I shall not live to see those evil days, for I
feel that my departure is near at hand; but you may
expect to behold the vengeance of the Lord executed on
the rebellious city, which has been blessed and favoured
above all other cities on the earth.  May you all be
preserved from sharing her punishment, as, by the
mercy of your Redeemer, your souls have been snatched
from her guilt!  Naomi, my beloved child in the Lord,
I know your determination to abide with your parents;
and I believe that you are acting according to the will
of God.  Therefore, come what may, I know that you
are safe in his hands; and that whether in sorrow or in
joy, in life or in death, his eye shall watch over you, and
his hand shall guide you, until at last he shall bring you
to those heavenly joys for which your ransomed spirit
pants already."
</p>

<p>
Mary paused awhile, for her feelings were unchilled
by age, and they were too powerful for her strength.
Theophilus begged her to converse no more at that
time, and promised that he would on the following
evening bring his young companions again, to hear the
remainder of her interesting recital; but she assured him
that it was her greatest delight to discourse with them
of those events which were so indelibly impressed on her
own heart.
</p>

<p>
"How," she added, "can I better spend the small
remains of time and strength which I still receive from
his mercy, than by telling of all that he has done and
suffered for my soul, and for the souls of those who
hear me; yea, even for the souls of the thoughtless and
guilty multitude, who refused to listen to the things that
belonged to their peace, and who so soon exchanged the
hosannas and blessings with which they hailed his
entrance into their city, for menaces and cries of 'Crucify
him, crucify him!'  Doubtless had the children of Zion
by faith beheld their King; had they repented in
sack-cloth and ashes, like the inhabitants of Nineveh at the
preaching of Jonah, and wept and prayed unto the Lord,
even then the judgment might have been reversed, and
mercy have triumphed.  But they hardened their hearts,
they killed the Holy One and the Just, and the city
which saw his death must see his vengeance.  The day on
which our Master made his public entrance into
Jerusalem, he passed much time in the temple, preaching
and teaching the people; and when eventide was come,
he again returned to our dwelling, accompanied by his
twelve apostles.
</p>

<p>
"Again on the following morning he repaired to the
temple, and to the astonishment of the priests and elders,
he drove out all those who were profaning his Father's
house by buying and selling within the sacred courts.
They were filled with indignation at his boldness, and
at the applauses of the multitude; and these ministers,
appointed for God's service, who should have led the
people to the feet of Jesus, to listen to his words, took
counsel how they might slay him, because many believed
on him.  But as yet they feared to take him, for they
saw that the multitude who constantly surrounded him
would rise up in his defence; and that night also he
returned unmolested to Bethany.  It was not till the
following evening that the traitor Judas went to the chief
priests, and offered to deliver up his master into their
hands; and the next day was the Passover.  The
treachery of Judas, and the determination of the chief
priests to put him to death, must have been well known
to the Lord; yet he openly went again to the city, and
eat the Passover with his twelve disciples, not even
excluding him who had already betrayed him.  Then did
he institute that holy feast, which it is the happiness and
privilege of his disciples, in every age and every land, to
celebrate in remembrance of him.  You, Theophilus and
Naomi, have already been permitted to partake of this
memorial of your Saviour's dying love, and our dear
Claudia will soon enjoy the same privilege.  May it ever
be your highest joy thus to declare yourselves his
disciples; and may you so eat his flesh and drink his blood
that you may be partakers in the salvation which by his
death he purchased for you.  When our beloved Master
left Bethany on the day of the Passover, we little thought
of the circumstances under which we should next behold
him, and that he would never again return to our house
before his death.  But that very night the treacherous
schemes of Judas were accomplished.  I have often
repeated to you already, what I afterwards heard from
the blessed disciple John, of the gracious and affecting
discourse which he addressed to his chosen followers
before he left the room in which he had eaten his last
supper; and how, having sung a hymn with them, he
repaired to the garden which you have visited to-day,
and passed hours in deep and mysterious agony, such
as we cannot comprehend.  There, to a retired and
favourite spot, where Judas had often followed his
Master, he now led the soldiers who were commissioned
to take him.  No admiring multitude now stood round
him, to prevent the deed of sacrilege.  The darkness of
night shrouded alike the divine sufferer and his
malignant enemies.  The powers of evil were abroad, and
were permitted in that hour to bring to pass what had
been decreed in the everlasting counsels of Jehovah.
Even the chosen disciples, the lion-hearted Peter and
the devoted John, were sunk in sleep, worn out with
sorrow and anxiety, and watched not with their sorrowing
Lord, until he roused them to meet the approaching
foe.  Oh! my heart burns when I think of the insult
which he then received from Judas.  The traitor met
him with a kiss!  And the Lord of heaven and earth,
who could have called down legions of angels to his
defence, submitted to the salutation, and suffered himself
to be bound and led away unresistingly, as a lamb to the
slaughter.  The rumour that he was taken prisoner by
the chief priests reached us at Bethany before break of
day; and in anguish not to be told, we hastened to the
city.  We found that he had been led to Ananius first,
and at the entrance of his court we waited in trembling
anxiety, until we beheld him brought forth, not, as we
hoped, to freedom, but only to be dragged from thence
to the palace of Caiaphas.  John was permitted to follow
his Master into the palace, and my heart went with him,
but we were not allowed to enter.  Soon the beloved
disciple returned and took in Peter also: but it had been
well for him if he had not been admitted.  You all know
how Satan overcame him, and how grievously he fell.
That fall has been a warning to us all; and may we be
instructed by it!  But we will not dwell on the errors
of that distinguished and now glorified disciple.  They
were pardoned by his benign Master, and are only
recorded for our instruction."
</p>

<p>
"Was John standing by him when he uttered his
denial?" asked Claudia.  "I think the affectionate heart
of the disciple whom Jesus loved must have been deeply
wounded to hear such words from the mouth of his
companion."
</p>

<p>
"John had followed the Lord Jesus into the presence
of the high-priest, and did not therefore witness the
cowardice of Peter.  But he who knew even the thoughts
of their hearts, heard his name denied three times; and
it must have added to the sorrows that already weighed
so heavily on his soul.  But pity was all he felt; and he
turned on Peter such a look as reached him in the
distant crowd, and told him at once of the grief and the
forgiveness of his Master.  His repentance was instant
and sincere, and with bitter tears he mourned his
guilt."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see Jesus again, Mary?" inquired Claudia.
"I know that he was at length condemned by our Roman
governor; but where did that take place?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! my child, they led him from court to court, and
from one judge to another.  They insulted and scourged
him; they clothed him in robes of mockery; and we
saw him thus brought forth to the people by Pilate, and
heard him loudly proclaim that he found no fault in him.
Then we believed that he would be set free, and that his
humiliation was over.  But Pilate's declaration of his
innocence was received with deafening cries of 'Crucify
him, crucify him!'  The chief priests moved the people
to demand his death, and their voices prevailed over
Pilate's own conviction that he had done no evil.  A
murderer was released, according to the custom of the
governor to set one prisoner at liberty on that day, and
Jesus was led away to be crucified.  Tearless, and almost
stupified, my sister and I followed in the crowd.  We could
not believe that what we had seen and heard was true;
but soon we beheld our own adored Master bending
beneath the weight of the cross on which he was to suffer.
I cannot dwell on what followed.  You have all heard
the particulars of that dread hour, and all have learned
to cast your souls at the foot of that cross, and seek
salvation there.  Martha and I stood afar off; we could
not leave the spot, nor could we bring ourselves to
approach nearer to the scene of suffering.  But the mother
of the Lord stood by, attended by three of her faithful
friends, and the beloved disciple supported her.  She
who had watched over his infancy, and noted in her
heart every manifestation of his divine nature&mdash;she who
had ever received from him the affection of a son, now
stood beneath his cross, and saw his dying agonies.
Not even the horrors of that hour could make him
forget his mother; he looked down and blessed her
and with his dying breath committed her to the care of
John."
</p>

<p>
"And he well discharged the trust," observed Theophilus.
"My father has often told me of his devoted
attention to her while she lived.  He was indeed a son
to her; and nothing which could soothe her spirit or
promote her comfort was neglected by John.  With
what impatient delight do I look forward to seeing that
blessed man at Ephesus!  He will repeat to me again
and again all that you have told me so often, Mary; and
by God's help I shall learn from him yet more and more
to love my risen Lord.  Oh, if I had lived while Jesus
was on earth, I feel as if my love for him would have
emulated that of John!  He is indeed blessed beyond all
the other sons of men; for he is that disciple who was
eminently beloved.  He was privileged to hold such
intimate communion with him as we can never know."
</p>

<p>
"True, my son," replied Mary, "the Lord will return
no more to earth as a man of sorrows, and deign to
accept the sympathy and the humble services of his
disciples.  But your eyes, Theophilus, shall wake to see
him come in glory; and if your faith and love hold on
steadfast unto the end, you shall meet him as a friend,
and enjoy such proofs of his favour as shall far surpass
all that were ever bestowed even on John."
</p>

<p>
"But tell me," interrupted Claudia, "what did you
see and hear of the fearful prodigies that attended the
death of Messiah?  I love to hear the recital from you,
who were an eye-witness of all the awful events which
declared him to be indeed the Son of God.  My father
once mentioned with contempt the centurion, who at
that moment confessed his divinity; but he knew not
the truth of all that then occurred to force conviction on
the heart of the Roman soldier.  It is my warmest
prayer that one day I may hear him also exclaim, 'Truly
this was the Son of God!'"
</p>

<p>
"May the Lord grant it!" replied Mary.  "No soul
that was not blinded by the devices of Satan could have
witnessed what that centurion saw and not have believed.
An awful darkness had covered the land for three hours,
and then, when all had been accomplished&mdash;when pardon
had been pronounced on the expiring thief&mdash;when an
asylum had been provided for his heart-broken mother&mdash;and
when everything had been fulfilled, even to the
letter, that had been prophesied concerning him&mdash;the
Lord proclaimed in a loud voice, 'It is finished!'  Heaven
and earth heard the cry, and man's redemption
was complete.  Then he said, 'Father, into thy hands
I commend my spirit;'&mdash;and bowing his head in death,
his divine spirit left the house of clay in which it had so
long sojourned and suffered.  Then did the powers of
nature give evidence to the awful importance of the
work that was finished.  The earth quaked to its foundations,
the rocks were rent asunder, and the graves burst
open.  And more ominous still, the veil of the temple
was rent asunder, and the priests who were waiting
there rushed forth in terror, to declare the wonderful
event.  The hearts of the multitude, who had come
together as to a spectacle, were stricken with awe.  They
smote their breasts, and returned in wonder to their
homes.  But we who knew and loved him best, yet
tarried to watch his corpse.  We knew that all life was
fled, for we had seen his body pierced by the spear of
one of the soldiers; but we could not leave his sacred
form to be the object of their insults.  We had not
power or influence sufficient to obtain permission to
bury it; but Joseph of Arimathea, who believed in him,
and feared not to acknowledge his faith, even at that
time of danger and distrust, went boldly to the Roman
governor, and having requested the body of Jesus, it
was delivered to him for interment.  It was the weakness
of our faith which led us to be so anxious about the
burying of our Lord's body; for had we believed all
that he himself had said concerning his rising again the
third day, we should have known that all our cares and
precautions for its preservation was needless.  But as
yet we knew not the Scriptures nor the power of God
and when the Lord was laid in the sepulchre of Joseph,
we saw a great stone laid against the door, and
departed with the melancholy satisfaction of knowing
that all due respect had been paid to his honoured
remains."
</p>

<p>
"But how wonderfully," observed Naomi, "was this
very circumstance made to show forth the truth of God's
word!  The Jews even now say that his disciples came
by night and took him away; and such is my father's
reply, when I speak of his miraculous resurrection.
But he cannot deny the security of the sepulchre.  He
acknowledges that the stone was sealed, and a watch was
set by the chief priests.  Surely then their own
precautions prove the falsity of what they say."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my child," continued Mary, "the malice of
these wicked men was overruled by God, to accomplish
what he had desired; and their jealous prudence was
the means of proving that he did not suffer his Holy
One to see corruption.  While we, his weak and
sorrowing disciples, were mourning his death with bitter
tears, and hiding our grief in solitude, for fear of the
vengeance of the priests, the Lord was preparing for us
such joy and triumph as our desponding hearts could not
conceive.  What words can tell the feelings which
over-powered us when first we heard the glorious news, 'He
is risen!'  And oh! when at length we saw him, when
our eyes were blessed with the sight of his heavenly
countenance, and we heard again that voice of mercy
and of love, truly could we then have taken up the
words of the aged Simeon, and said, 'Lord, now are we
ready to depart in peace, for our eyes have seen thy
salvation!'  We knew that our redemption was
accomplished and accepted; we knew that henceforth whosoever
believed in Jesus should inherit eternal life.  All
our doubts and fears were gone, and peace and joy for
ever established in our souls.  The Lord did not tarry
long with us, but ascended to his Father.  There does
he watch over his church, and sympathise in all the trials
and temptations of his children; and there do they join
him and behold his glory, as one by one the hand of
death comes to set them free from this earthly tabernacle,
and open to them an entrance into the mansions
of everlasting bliss.  Oh! my dear children, my spirit
longs to take its flight, and soon, I feel, will the
summons come."
</p>

<p>
Mary closed her eyes and sank back on her couch,
greatly exhausted by the effort she had made.  She
had hoped that the account of all that she herself had
heard and seen might make a deep impression on the
heart of Claudia, and she was not disappointed; but
her strength was almost unequal to the exertion of so
long a discourse on subjects so profoundly interesting
to her, and for a few minutes she lay silent and
motionless, while in her spirit she fervently prayed.  Her
young friends and her faithful attendant Hannah, who
had listened to the conversation with deep attention,
stood round her in silence, until she had somewhat
recovered her strength, when she raised herself, and
again addressed them, but in a weak and faltering
voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The evening is closing in, my children, and you
have already tarried too long with me.  I will detain
you no more: but if we meet again in this world, I
will tell you yet many things that will touch your hearts
with love to your Redeemer, and furnish you with
blessed subjects for reflection when youth and health
are gone, and you are, like me, laid on the bed of
death.  Let me bless you before you depart."
</p>

<p>
The three young disciples knelt beside the couch of
the dying saint, and with tears received her blessing.
They then rose, and embracing her affectionately, left
the house and hastened towards the city.  The sun was
sinking behind the hill of Zion as they began to descend
the Mount of Olives, and the short twilight had faded
away before they reached the valley of Kedron, and
entered the gardens that bordered the murmuring brook.
</p>

<p>
Their spirits were oppressed with awe and sadness, for
the solemn interest of Mary's discourse had deeply
impressed them, and her parting address had filled them
with sorrow.  They felt assured that their beloved friend
was leaving them; and though it would be to her a
transition from a world of care to a world of joy
unutterable and full of glory, yet they could not think of
losing her without emotion.  They proceeded almost
in silence, until, as they were passing by the verge
of a thick grove of olive-trees, Claudia pressed the arm
of Theophilus, and hastily whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Theophilus: some one is surely watching us.
I have heard footsteps behind us several times; but I
saw nothing, and I feared you would chide me for
cowardice if I spoke my fears.  But now I am sure we
are followed.  I saw the figure of a man folded in a dark
garment pass stealthily beneath those trees."
</p>

<p>
"Why should you fear, my Claudia?" replied Theophilus.
"No one can harm us here.  See, the gates are
in sight, and I can perceive the dim forms of the
watch-men moving slowly along the walls.  We are within
reach of help, and I am armed, so do not tremble."
</p>

<p>
"I do not fear for myself, Theophilus, but for you and
Naomi.  If Javan knew of our visits to Bethany&mdash;if
Javan knew that his sister and his cousin were disciples
of Jesus&mdash;oh, I believe no ties of blood would prevent
him from denouncing you to the tyrants who make
religion a mask for cruelty and murder."
</p>

<p>
"Silence, dear Claudia," said Naomi in a low whisper;
"your eagerness makes you forget that you are perhaps
within hearing of the person whom you think you saw
lurking so near.  Let us proceed quickly.  I cannot
share your fears, but I dread my father's inquiries as to
the cause of our long absence."
</p>

<p>
A short time sufficed to bring them to the threshold
of Zadok's house, where Deborah met them with a
countenance of alarm and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you so late, my children?" she exclaimed.
"I have been watching from the housetop in great
uneasiness, until it became so dark that I could no
longer distinguish the road up the Mount of Olives.
Javan came in soon after you left the house, and asked
eagerly in what direction you had walked out.  My fears
told me that you were gone to Bethany; but I concealed
my suspicions, and tried to persuade your brother that
you were gone by Solomon's pool, towards the valley of
Hinnom.  He looked stern and angry, and without
replying hurried from the house."
</p>

<p>
"Then," cried Claudia, "my fears were not unfounded,
and it was Javan himself who followed us.  Something
in the figure of the person I saw reminded me of him;
and yet I tried to believe it could not be.  Gracious
Heaven! preserve us from his vengeance!"
</p>

<p>
Both Theophilus and Naomi were greatly alarmed at
what Deborah had communicated, for they had lately
heard Javan express himself with so much bitter hatred
towards the Nazarenes that they felt convinced he would
use all his influence for the persecution and destruction
of any who bore the name; and they feared that even
those who were of his near kindred would be sacrificed
to his zeal and fanaticism.  Claudia entreated Theophilus
to leave them instantly, that Javan might not return and
find them together; and also that he might repair to
his father's apartments and inform him of what had
occurred.  He complied with her wishes, and was passing
across the vestibule, towards the gallery that led to the
suite of rooms occupied exclusively by his parents,
when Javan entered, and in a voice of assumed kindness
called to him to return.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Theophilus," he said, "I have seen but little
of you lately, my time has been so much engaged.  I
have to thank you for so well supplying my place, and
giving a brother's protection to Naomi in her evening
rambles.  Let us go altogether to the terrace, and join
my father and mother, and you can entertain us with an
account of your lengthened excursion, for you have been
absent so long that you must doubtless have wandered
far beyond the pool of Solomon."
</p>

<p>
There was an ill-suppressed tone of irony in what
Javan said, that was but too well understood by those
to whom it was addressed.  Claudia turned deadly pale,
and even Naomi felt that she had need of all her
resolution to enable her to follow her brother.  Theophilus
calmly turned, and with an air of perfect composure
joined his cousin, saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I believe an account of what we have heard and
seen this evening will interest you all; and I claim to
narrate it myself.  Naomi and Claudia, you are not to
interrupt me."
</p>

<p>
He accompanied this injunction with a warning
look, which told the two maidens that he had some
plan which he feared they might impede.  The terrace
they found unoccupied, and Javan left his companions
there while he sought his parents.  Theophilus
immediately seized the opportunity to inform Naomi and
Claudia that he plainly saw that Javan had discovered
the object of their walk, and that his suspicions were
excited.
</p>

<p>
"But," he added, "I believe I can baffle his inquiries,
and ensure your safety, provided you both promise to be
silent, and leave the explanation to me.  You know that
I will say nothing but what is true and right."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," said Claudia, "I will leave it all to you;
and though Naomi does love to speak for herself, she
must agree to do the same.  I never wish, for my own
part, to have anything to say to your fierce cousin."
</p>

<p>
"Claudia," replied Naomi, "you think too ill of my
brother.  His temper is warm, and his zeal sometimes
makes him appear vindictive; but he has an affectionate
heart; and to me he has shown much kindness since
his return.  Let us not anticipate evil, for perhaps we
are even mistaken in supposing that he suspects our visits
to Bethany, or at all events that he is aware of their
object.  I will get my harp, and sing to him some of his
favourite hymns.  In former days I could always drive
away the evil spirit from his soul by my music, and now
I hope it has not lost its charm.  Do not say anything
rash, Theophilus, and I will promise not to interfere with
your schemes."
</p>

<p>
Naomi spoke more cheerfully than she felt, for she saw
that Claudia was trembling with apprehension, and that
Theophilus had evidently resolved on some measure of
importance.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
</h3>

<p>
At this moment Javan returned, and with an air of
gaiety that ill accorded with the dark feelings of his
heart, summoned his young companions to follow him.
</p>

<p>
"My mother," he said, "awaits you in the cedar hall,
where supper is prepared.  Rabbi Joazer is with her,
but my father is not yet come in.  We will have a merry
banquet to-night.  Come, you do not seem in a festal
mood, Theophilus.  This evening walk has wearied you,
and chased away your spirits."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I not sing to you, my brother?" interrupted
Naomi, who was fearful that her cousin might reply
hastily to Javan's taunt: "my harp used to beguile you
of many an hour in former times; but you have hardly
heard its tone since you came back to us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, child, bring your harp: it will serve to amuse
our ears until my father returns."
</p>

<p>
Naomi obeyed, for she felt that music would be better
than conversation in Javan's present mood.  She took
up her harp from the pedestal on which it lay in the
anteroom, and entered the apartment where her mother
sat, working at her embroidery by the light of a
richly-chased silver lamp.  Deborah had joined her after she
had met Naomi and her companions at the entrance,
and was now occupied in the same manner as her
mistress, assisted also by two of Salome's maidens.
The rabbi reclined on one of the couches which were
placed around the supper-table, according to the Jewish
manner of sitting at their meals; and the whole
arrangement of the apartment bespoke cheerfulness and comfort.
The hearts of several of its inmates responded not to
the bright scene around them.  Naomi approached her
mother, and affectionately saluted her, whispering at the
same time,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Javan looks unhappy and oppressed with care.  Do
not notice it, dear mother, but I will sing his gloom away."
</p>

<p>
So saying, she seated herself on a cushion at Salome's
feet, and striking a few chords on her harp, sang in her
wildest, sweetest tones, her brother's favourite song;
which she herself had composed when first the Roman
army threatened the safety of Zion:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Sing to the Lord!  Oh sing His praise!<br>
  Sons of Israel, loudly raise<br>
  Your voices to the King of kings&mdash;<br>
  Listen how all nature sings!<br>
  The golden spheres that roll above&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air that breathes around&mdash;<br>
  And all created things that move,<br>
  Declare the great Jehovah's love,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To earth's remotest bound.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angels, who dwell on high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In realms beyond the sky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike your immortal harps of gold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing how Israel's God, of old<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displayed His power.<br>
  Now may His banner be again unfurled;<br>
  And shouts of triumph tell from land to land,<br>
  That God on high hath raised His mighty hand,<br>
  And, from their boasted height of glory, hurled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foes in this dark hour!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It is long since I have heard that song, my Naomi,"
said her mother.  "It once was the hymn you loved
best to sing: but latterly you have preferred more
sorrowful strains."
</p>

<p>
"My spirit has lost that joyous feeling of confidence
in the triumph of my country, that animated it when I
first sang that song, dear mother.  But Javan used to
take delight in it; and I have tried to recall it now."
</p>

<p>
Naomi looked at her brother, hoping for a kind reply;
but the forced smile had left his features, and their
naturally stern expression had returned.  He sat with
folded arms, and his eyes cast down; while the compression
of his lips and contraction of his brow betokened
a fixed and a painful resolution.  Probably he knew
not that his sister had selected his favourite hymn to
please him; though he was glad that the sound of her
sweet voice gave him an excuse for continuing his
moody silence.
</p>

<p>
The entrance of his father aroused him from his
reverie, and the family assembled to partake of the
evening meal.  The ablutions prescribed by Jewish
superstition were duly performed; and with this form
Theophilus and Naomi always complied, as it was
perfectly immaterial, and in no way opposed their private
feelings.  Javan watched his cousin during the
performance of this simple ceremony with a look of scorn.
He seemed to feel that Theophilus was committing
profanation by sharing in the act; and lest he himself
should contract defilement from sitting at meat with an
apostate, he declined joining his family at supper, on
the plea of indisposition, and remained silent and
abstracted until the repast was finished, and the servants
had retired.  Then he turned to Theophilus and said,
</p>

<p>
"You promised us an interesting account of your
walk this evening.  I particularly wish to know in what
direction you went, and whither you led my sister and
Claudia.  I would have joined you, but when I returned
home, I found that you had left the house more than an
hour before."
</p>

<p>
The imperious and contemptuous tone of Javan's
voice struck all the party, and they saw that he
suspected something wrong; while Claudia's changing
countenance and evident agitation betrayed that there
was some ground for his suspicions.  Naomi had made
up her mind to what would probably follow; and after
all she had already undergone, she felt that her brother's
hatred and scorn would be an additional sorrow sent to
loosen her affections from this world.  Theophilus was
perfectly unmoved, and replied at once:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I perceive, Javan, that you have other reasons for
your inquiries than mere curiosity as to the direction of
our walk; therefore the most manly and ingenuous course
will be at once to tell you, what I am convinced you
already suspect, that I have this evening been to visit a
poor Christian friend; and that the interest I take in
her is not merely because she is aged and infirm, and on
her deathbed, but because she is a disciple of the Lord
Jesus Christ."
</p>

<p>
"Hear him, O righteous Zadok!" exclaimed the
rabbi, starting from his seat, with uplifted hands.  "The
demon of heresy has again found his way into your
family."
</p>

<p>
"Silence, Joazer," replied Zadok, who feared that in
his zeal the rabbi would forget that Javan was ignorant
of his sister's apostasy, and would inadvertently allude
to it.  "Silence, my friend, and suffer Theophilus to
explain himself more fully before we condemn him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I will explain everything," continued Theophilus
calmly.  "I am neither ashamed nor afraid to
declare that I hold the same faith with my dying friend,
and, like her, address my prayers to Jesus of Nazareth."
</p>

<p>
"I knew it," said Javan, with a glance of fierce
indignation; "and it is well that you have not
endeavoured to deceive me.  Tell me as frankly then, have
you dared to lead my sister to the dwelling of a Nazarene,
and suffered her to listen to the ravings of a dying
lunatic?  I know the wild belief and still wilder
assertions of the woman whom you have visited; and may
God forbid that any one connected with me should ever
be deluded with such folly."
</p>

<p>
"You know nothing of the Christian doctrines, Javan,
or you would not call them folly," replied Theophilus.
</p>

<p>
"You know that Claudia is betrothed to me, and can
you wonder if I seek by every means in my power to
convince her of the truth of that religion which I have
embraced myself?  Naomi accompanied me, and she
also entered the house of Mary of Bethany; but I may
truly say that I have never attempted to shake your
sister's faith, or in any way to influence her religious
feelings."
</p>

<p>
Theophilus glanced at Naomi, to remind her of her
promise to let him reply to Javan without interruption.
He saw her heightened colour and eager expression, and
feared that she would boldly avow her faith, rather than
tacitly take part in the subterfuge, which for her sake he
had employed.
</p>

<p>
Salome also guessed what was pacing in her daughter's
mind; and knowing the frankness and intrepidity
of her disposition, she was assured that if Javan in any
way appealed to her she would confess all her sentiments.
She therefore rose from her seat, and summoned
Naomi and Claudia to follow her to her own apartment;
observing to Zadok that she thought it better
they should not remain, but leave it to him and to
the rabbi to point out to Theophilus the error of his
ways.
</p>

<p>
Naomi reluctantly obeyed her mother's wishes, for
she felt as if she was guilty of hypocrisy and cowardice
in leaving her cousin to bear the whole blame of her
visit to Mary of Bethany.  But she saw that Salome
was alarmed&mdash;and her own heart told her not without
reason&mdash;at the idea of Javan's discovering her departure
from the Jewish faith; and to satisfy her she promised,
when they had reached another apartment, that as long
as it was possible to do so without compromising her
own sentiments, she would allow her brother to remain
in ignorance of them.  Claudia likewise was unwilling
to quit the cedar hall.  She was aware of the violence
of Javan's temper, and she feared that the cool
determination of Theophilus would perhaps exasperate him,
and excite him to cruelty and persecution; and therefore
she wished to remain and hear the result of the
debate, even if she could do nothing to soften its nature.
From Salome's chamber she could hear the angry voices
of Javan and the rabbi, and the more temperate tone of
expostulation employed by Zadok; and then the mild
and determined replies of Theophilus reached her ear,
though she could distinguish nothing of what was said.
The conference was long; and before it terminated
Judith came in search of her son, and found Salome
and the two maidens in a state of great anxiety.  The
account of what had occurred filled her with alarm for
the safety of Theophilus, for she knew far more than his
own family did of Javan's unrelenting hatred towards
the Christians, and of the active measures which he had
taken to discover and bring to punishment any of that
despised creed who yet lingered in or near the city.
</p>

<p>
She freely told her fears to Salome, and found in her
kind feelings both sympathy and comfort.  The sisters-in-law
had always entertained the most sincere affection
for each other; and the knowledge of Judith's having
adopted a different religion had not altered the
sentiments of Salome towards her.  They conversed together
on the best course to be pursued in order to save
Theophilus from his cousin's vengeance; and it was agreed
that it would be prudent to hasten the preparations for
their departure, and if possible leave Jerusalem before
Javan could have time to carry any schemes against his
liberty or life into execution.  Judith was leaving the
room to return to Amaziah, and inform him of what had
happened, when Theophilus met her.
</p>

<p>
"I am come, my dear aunt," he said, with some
emotion, "to bid you and Naomi farewell.  The discovery
that I am a disciple of the holy Jesus, has been
the signal of separation between us.  Zadok has laid on
me a peremptory command to see you no more after
this evening.  But whether we meet again in this world
or not, my prayers will be continued while I live, that
we may meet in a happier world, and there be all
united as one family before the throne of the Lamb.  I
feel confident, Salome, that the Lord will bring you to
himself.  Your prejudices are already weakened; and
our dear devoted Naomi will yet be the happy instrument
of leading her mother into the way of truth."
</p>

<p>
"Do not speak thus to me, Theophilus," replied
Salome; "your words have a strange influence over
me, but I must not listen to you on that subject.  I
feared that the result of your confession would be at least
a separation between you and your uncle's family.  God
grant that nothing yet more afflictive to you may follow!
Your father will doubtless see the necessity of hastening
his departure from the city, and I own I shall rejoice to
feel that you are safe in another country.  Javan never
loved you; and now I know that his dislike will increase
to hatred."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do not fear him, Salome," said Theophilus.
"He was certainly very violent during our recent
conversation; and even made use of threats, to induce me
to abjure my religion.  But our rulers are too much
engaged with civil discord and military preparation to
have leisure for religious persecution.  We cannot leave
Jerusalem until we receive Rufus's permission for
Claudia to accompany us.  She must leave the city with
us, and no personal considerations shall induce me to
depart without her."
</p>

<p>
"Theophilus," interrupted Claudia eagerly, "you
shall not remain in danger on my account.  If we do
not receive my father's reply to Amaziah's letter by the
time that you are ready to set out, I tell you frankly
that if your mother will take charge of me, I will at
once accompany her, and wait at Joppa for my father's
consent to our marriage.  Do not think me forward in
saying this, dear Judith," she added, colouring deeply:
"but I confess I have always had a secret dread of
Javan, ever since I knew that Theophilus and Naomi
had become Christians; and I shall not feel easy until
we are out of his reach.  Oh! that my dear Naomi
would also go with us, and dwell in safety at Ephesus,
until happier days dawn on Jerusalem, and her brother's
hatred against our creed has subsided."
</p>

<p>
"I would join in the request," said Judith, "but I
know that it would be useless.  Naomi will not desert
her mother to ensure her own safety; and she is right.
For you, my dear Claudia, circumstances are widely
different; and you do quite right in resolving to go
with us and your betrothed husband.  I have no doubt
of your father's cheerful consent to your marriage, for
he has no home himself to which he can invite you to
return; and Jerusalem is no longer a desirable or safe
abode for you.  You shall be our beloved daughter, and
I will seek to replace to you the parent whom you have
lost."
</p>

<p>
"Zadok will not oppose your kind determination,
Claudia," said Theophilus; "for at Javan's urgent
request he declared that you, as well as myself, should
be prohibited from all intercourse with Naomi, except
in his own or Salome's presence.  Javan fears that you
may communicate to her the heresies you have learnt
from me; and he will rejoice in your departure."
</p>

<p>
"Naomi, dearest Naomi," cried Claudia, "and am I
then to be deprived of your society so soon?  Is the
short time which must elapse ere the wide ocean divides
us to be embittered by your brother's cruel plans?  I
will not consent to it.  I will appeal to Zadok.  He
knows that it is from you and Theophilus I have learnt
the blessed faith that I will cherish to my dying hour;
and I can have no power to teach you anything.  Let
me remain with you, my sister, my friend, until I leave
you, perhaps for ever!"
</p>

<p>
Claudia threw herself into the arms of Naomi, with a
sudden burst of grief; and her friend could no longer
restrain her own emotions.  She saw that almost all her
earthly comforts were about to be torn from her, and
that she would be left alone to bear her father's
displeasure, and probably soon to incur her brother's
hatred and cruel oppression.  Her mother would, she
knew, be ever her kind and sympathising friend; but
even she could not enter into all her feelings, or talk
with her on the only subject that could now interest
her.  Of Marcellus she had heard nothing for some time
past, and when Claudia should have left Jerusalem, she
could not hope to receive any intelligence of him.
Probably he would soon forget her; and at all events
she felt that they were never likely to meet again.
Her heart was heavily oppressed, and she wept silently
and sadly.
</p>

<p>
Javan's abrupt entrance roused her from her anticipated
sorrows, to a sense of present trials.
</p>

<p>
"Your farewell has been a long one, Theophilus: it
is high time that my mother and sister were relieved
from the presence of an apostate.  Are you in tears,
Naomi, at parting with Claudia too?  The admission
of a heathen idolater into our family has brought with it
the curse I expected.  Even my father's blood is infected
with worse than Roman idolatry.  The name of the
Nazarene impostor is invoked beneath my father's roof.
But I will purge out the poison, and see that it
spreads no further.  Truly, Judith, if you knew of your
son's infidelity and madness, you should have warned us
of it, and not have suffered him to hold converse with my
sister.  You should have done more.  If he refused to
listen to the counsels of Amaziah, and return to the
true faith, you should have denounced him to the council.
What are all earthly ties compared to the honour of
Jehovah?  With my own hand would I wipe away the
stain of idolatry from my family.  And yet," he added,
in a lower and sterner voice, "and yet it may be my lot
to do so.  Judith, if you and Amaziah are partakers in
the impiety of your son, I warn you that it will be
discovered; and even the brother of Zadok shall not be
screened from offended justice.  You need not reply.  I
have my suspicions; and we will see whether they are
well founded.  Now leave us, and take your adopted
daughter with you.  She never was a proper companion
for a Jewish maiden.  Probably she may become a more
suitable wife for a Nazarene apostate."
</p>

<p>
Claudia caught the arm of Theophilus, trembling
with fear and indignation, and urged him to leave the
room.
</p>

<p>
It was Christian forbearance, and consideration for
Salome and Naomi, that alone preserved the
high-spirited young man from replying to Javan with the
severity which he well merited; but he remembered
Him who "when he was reviled, reviled not again," and
bridling his natural feelings of resentment, he led his
mother and Claudia out of the apartment.  When they
were gone, Salome with tears besought her son to lay
aside his anger, and for her sake to take no measures
against his father's relatives.  Naomi joined her
entreaties to those of her mother; but they could prevail
little with the fanatical Javan, who used no moderate
terms in expressing his opinion not only of Theophilus,
but also of his parents: and the family retired to rest
with agitated and uneasy feelings.
</p>

<p>
The following day Javan was absent from home until
late in the afternoon, when he came to inform his father
that Mary, the daughter of Eleazar, the wealthy lady of
Bethezob, had arrived in Jerusalem, having at length
followed his counsel, and sought safety for herself and
her numerous suite of attendants in the Holy City.  She
wished to procure a large and handsome dwelling for
herself; but Javan told his father that he had assured
her she would receive a welcome to his house, until a
suitable habitation could be found for her.  Zadok
readily confirmed his son's offer, and hastened with him
to meet his wife's relative, and conduct her from the inn
at which she had stopped to his own spacious house.
Both Zadok and his wife had a great regard for Mary,
though the expensive and luxurious mode in which she
always lived was entirely at variance with the simplicity
of their own manners.  It is true that the dwelling of
the priest was large and well-furnished, and everything
in it wore an air of comfort and elegance; but personal
luxury and expensive indulgences he entirely despised.
His whole equipage, his domestics and attendants, and
the attire of his family, were in proper accordance to
his rank and station and the customs of his country;
but in these things he took no delight, and his children
had been brought up to regard them with perfect
indifference.  Not so Mary of Bethezob.  Her mother
had died while she was very young, and had left her
to the care of a falsely-indulgent father, who allowed
her every luxury that his vast wealth could command,
and encouraged her to gratify every selfish
inclination that arose in her breast.  She was very lovely,
and her manners were sweet and engaging; but her
passions were strong and unrestrained by paternal
discipline.  Early in life she married a man of piety and
good sense, who would probably have greatly improved
her character had he lived.  But he had died a year
before the time when Javan visited her in Persea, and
she was left a young and beautiful widow of independence
and power, with one lovely little child scarcely two
years old.
</p>

<p>
Mary was most kindly received by her relatives, and
Naomi found consolation and delight in the playful
affection of the little David, who attached himself to her
immediately, and became her constant companion.
Judith and Claudia she saw but seldom, and that only
in the presence of her mother or Javan, when no allusion
to the subject of religion was permitted, and the
conversation chiefly turned on their approaching departure.
At this time a letter from Rufus was received by his
daughter.  It was conveyed by an emissary from the
Roman general, who wished once more to make an
attempt to persuade the rebel Jews to lay down their
arms, and for this purpose he wrote to the chiefs and
rulers of the city.  His proposals were received, as
before, with a scornful rejection, and the messenger
departed, carrying the offensive reply, and also charged
with a letter from Claudia to her father, expressing her
grateful thanks for his ready consent to all the
arrangements of Amaziah.  Rufus was rejoiced at the prospect
of his daughter's happiness; and not less so at the idea
of her so soon being removed from the threatened city
of Jerusalem.  He knew that the siege of the metropolis
was resolved on by Vespasian, unless the inhabitants
submitted again to the authority of Rome; and he was
too well acquainted with the pride and obstinacy of the
leading Jews to hope that this step would ever be taken
by them.  He therefore felt how dangerous was his
daughter's situation; and he had intended to request
the ambassador of Vespasian to take charge of her, and
bring her to join him in the Roman camp, when he
received the letter of Amaziah to demand her in marriage
for his son.  He knew and esteemed the brother of
Zadok; and though he would have preferred a Roman
to a Jew as a husband for his daughter, yet he would
not decline so respectable an alliance, and one that
promised to procure her safety and happiness in the
present unsettled state of the country, and indeed of the
whole empire.
</p>

<p>
We have said before that the subject of religion was
not one of any great importance in the opinion of Rufus:
he considered that good moral conduct was all that was
incumbent on mankind; and as he knew that both Amaziah
and his son were remarkable for their excellent lives
and honourable behaviour on all occasions, he required
nothing more.  But Marcellus looked to higher principles;
and when he heard of his sister's intended marriage, it
was with sincere joy that he remembered the piety and
the pure devotional feelings which he had observed in
the family of Amaziah during his residence in Jerusalem.
He knew not that the conduct of that family was
actuated by Christian motives, or he would indeed have
rejoiced at the prospect of his sister's connection with
them; but at all events he knew that they were sincere
worshippers of the one true God, and his dear Claudia
would be preserved from all danger of falling back
into idolatry.  He therefore joyfully acceded to his
father's proposal that they should obtain their general's
permission to leave the camp for a short time, and repair
to Joppa to meet Amaziah and his party; and that
Claudia's marriage should take place there, instead of
the ceremony being performed at Jerusalem, according
to the wish of Theophilus and his parents.  All this
plan was duly explained in the letters of Rufus to his
daughter and Amaziah, and readily agreed to, as Claudia
was overjoyed at the idea of seeing her father and
brother before she left Judea, and also of their being
present to sanction and bless her marriage.
</p>

<p>
Rufus further proposed that Zadok and Naomi should
accompany their relatives, and promised that if they
would consent to do so, he would send a guard of soldiers
to meet them at Lydda, and conduct them safely to
Joppa, where a number of Roman soldiers were stationed.
He knew that it would be a great gratification to Claudia
to have her friends' presence on such an occasion; and
it would also give him an opportunity of renewing his
acquaintance with friends whom he so highly esteemed,
and to whom he felt so deeply indebted for their
kindness to his daughter.
</p>

<p>
Claudia flew to Zadok with her father's letter, and
rested not until she had obtained his promise to comply
with all his arrangements.  She then repaired to Salome's
apartment, and joyfully communicated all the welcome
intelligence to Naomi and her mother, and received their
affectionate congratulations on the happy termination
which was thus put to all her anxieties as to the nature
of Rufus's reply to Amaziah's letter.  Shall we say that
Naomi's heart beat violently, and her colour came and
went with rapid changes when she heard that she was
to meet Marcellus at Joppa?  Various feelings added
to her emotion.  It was now several years since she had
seen the Roman youth, and he might be changed from
what she remembered him.  The kindness and the
amiable disposition that had won her young heart might
have worn away amid the rough scenes of a military
life; or, if he still remained the same engaging and
noble-spirited creature that once she loved, (and this his
letters to Claudia led her to believe,) yet his affection
for her might have died away, and then he would meet
her only as his sister's friend.  She tried to believe that
she could bear this change with great heroism; and at
all events she thought that it was better she should see
him and know the real state of his feelings at once,
and then school her own heart to a corresponding
degree of indifference.
</p>

<p>
His merely Jewish faith&mdash;as she considered it to be&mdash;was
a source of anxiety to her; for while she rejoiced
that he was no longer an idolater, she knew that under
any circumstances it was her duty to check every hope
of being united to him while he acknowledged not the
truth of the creed which she had adopted.  And how could
she expect that time or opportunity would be afforded
her to tell him all the wondrous stories which had so
powerfully affected her own opinions, or that power
should be given her so to set forth the Christian
doctrines as to touch his heart and convince his reason?
She could not communicate all these doubts and fears to
Claudia had she even felt so inclined, for the prohibition
to their having any private intercourse was not retracted;
but they occupied her own thoughts while she made
her preparations for the intended journey.
</p>

<p>
Mary of Bethezob removed to a large house in the
street adjoining that in which Zadok lived; and when
she was established there, she gave way to her natural
inclination for gaiety and festivity, and assembled all the
thoughtless members of her acquaintance at frequent
and magnificent entertainments, utterly regardless of
the misery and distress that surrounded her, or of the
civil tumults and wild seditions that threatened the
safety of the city both by night and by day.  Javan
was a constant visitor at Mary's house, and made it his
place of meeting with those chief men of the popular
party whom he was anxious to conciliate and bring
over to the schemes of Simon.  He despised the levity
and ill-timed gaiety of Mary; but he found it convenient
to frequent her parties, and appear to share in the
festivities in which she delighted, for by this means he
became less an object of suspicion to those who opposed
his views, and he was able to meet and converse with his
coadjutors unnoticed by the gay throng who were only
occupied with the pleasures of the present moment.
</p>

<p>
Javan had also other projects and other schemes,
which he pursued with no less eagerness and activity
than his political efforts in favour of the son of Gioras.
He had not forgotten his wrath against Theophilus, or
laid aside his threatened plans of vengeance.  He had
used every effort to discover the few remaining disciples
of Jesus of Nazareth who yet tarried in the city,
detained by ties of duty or affection from fleeing with
their brethren to Pella; and his endeavours had been
so far successful, that already several unhappy creatures
had been seized upon and cast into dungeons by those
of the priests and Pharisees who shared his fanatical
feelings and cruel spirit of persecution.  All proper
legal authority had long been suspended, and power
was all that constituted a right to punish or oppress the
weaker party.  A council of priests and elders therefore
assembled to decide according to their own will, on
the fate of these innocent victims, and Javan was
one of their number.  His judgment was for death; but
he requested his colleagues to defer the execution of the
righteous sentence until he was able to add at least one
more to the number of the criminals, which he assured
them he had no doubt of doing.  He informed them of his
discovery of Theophilus's apostasy, and his suspicions that
his parents also shared his opinions; but he had hitherto
abstained from taking his cousin into custody, as he
wished for stronger proofs of the guilt of his uncle and
Judith before he took so decided a measure against
their son as would open their eyes to their own danger,
and warn them either to take steps to conceal their
opinions, or to flee at once from the city, and thus escape
their merited doom.  The self-constituted tribunal readily
agreed to his suggestions, and warmly applauded his
disinterested zeal, which could thus lead him to sacrifice
all private and family feelings in his eagerness to
promote the honour of Jehovah, and extirpate the abominable
heresy which had already spread its baneful influence
so far and wide among the children of Abraham.  Much
was said by these proud Pharisees about the merit of
such noble actions, and the favour of God which would
be earned by their performance.&mdash;How profoundly
ignorant were they of the real character of that God
whose holy name they profaned! and how little did they
act or feel in accordance with his gracious declaration,
"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice!"
</p>

<p>
The council broke up, and Javan proceeded to carry
on his inquiries as to the evidence which could be
produced of the defection of Amaziah and his wife from
the faith of Abraham.  Nor was the humble Mary of
Bethany forgotten.  Spies were sent several times to
her dwelling, to ascertain with certainty her mode of
life and the nature of her worship.  They returned to
Javan with an affecting report of her declining state
and the heavenly calmness of her mind and conversation
and he resolved to visit her himself, and endeavour to
obtain her own confession, and hear her own declarations
of the ground of her faith and hope.  He had a profound
contempt of the doctrines of the Christians, as
well as a hatred for those who professed them.  Their
heroical endurance of sufferings and death for the name
of their Master appeared to him to be obstinate bigotry;
and the heavenly hopes that cheered their spirits and
swelled their hearts with joy in the midst of agony and
shame, he regarded as the effect of madness, and the
delusions of evil spirits leading them on to destruction.
Whatever therefore would tend to the extirpation of
such a creed, and deter his countrymen from adopting
it, he considered to be meritorious, and even benevolent;
and if by the infliction of torments or the terrors of
death, any nominal Christians were induced to renounce
their religion, it was a matter of sincere joy to him, as
he believed that their souls were thus saved from
perdition.  To such lengths may prejudice and fanaticism
lead even those who are zealous for the honour of God,
while they remain ignorant of that blessed spirit of
humility and charity, so beautifully taught both by the
life and doctrine of our divine Redeemer.
</p>

<p>
A day had been fixed for the departure of Amaziah
and his companions; and as it approached, Claudia
became nervously impatient for the time to arrive when
they should be safe beyond the walls of Jerusalem.
Her dread of Javan increased daily; and though he
endeavoured in his intercourse with Amaziah's family
to appear friendly and at his ease, and to dispel the fears
that his unguarded threats had excited, yet her watchful
anxiety detected that his manner was unnatural, and his
kindness and cheerfulness were entirely forced.  She
felt a dreadful foreboding of evil which she could not
conquer, and all the efforts of Theophilus to dispel her
fears, and his repeated assurances that he entertained
no suspicions or apprehensions of his cousin, failed to
restore her peace and confidence.  She had no longer
the sanguine and hopeful spirit of Naomi to cheer
her as formerly, and charm away her fears; and indeed
Naomi herself was not now the same light-hearted being
that once she was.  Her natural spirits were subdued
by care and by deep and serious reflection; but her
trust in God, and perfect confidence in his overruling
Providence, and his fatherly care for his children in
Christ, had replaced the buoyant feelings that arose
from youth and health and happiness, and conscious
powers of mind and body.
</p>

<p>
Naomi saw that her friend was uneasy, and she shared
her apprehensions, for she perceived that her brother's
mind was disturbed, and that he was evidently engaged
in some pursuit which made him more gloomy and
abstracted than ever.  He also questioned her frequently
as to the sentiments of Theophilus, and appeared to
indulge a hope that he would abandon his new religion,
and return to the faith in which he was brought up.
Occasionally he would lament that so well-disposed a
youth should have become the victim of such wild
delusions; and endeavour, as if casually, to discover from
his sister whether Amaziah and Judith were infected
with the same heresy.  He had never yet been informed
of their removal to Pella, and Naomi's residence with
them there, which was known only to his own family.
He supposed that his sister had dwelt with them in their
country-house in Bethany during her long absence from
home; and as he knew also that Theophilus had remained
in Jerusalem the whole of that time, he hoped that she
had escaped the pollution of his opinions.  Naomi
guessed his object in the questions he put to her, and
evaded them with wonderful quickness and ingenuity;
but from other sources he obtained the information which
he sought, and no doubt rested on his mind that his uncle
and aunt were Nazarenes in their hearts; and, worse
than all, that his sister had been instructed in their
detested doctrines.

MARY OF BETHANY INTERRUPTED BY JAVAN.
</p>

<p>
All his suspicions were communicated to his colleagues,
who urged him to use secrecy and dispatch in securing
such distinguished criminals.  The power and influence
of Zadok rendered great caution necessary in taking any
steps against the persons of his near relatives; and these
blood-thirsty men knew well that with all his zeal for
religion, and horror of all deviations from the faith of
his ancestors, and the customs which were sanctioned by
tradition, yet he would never give his consent to any act
of cruelty or oppression, or forget the feelings of a
brother, to gratify a spirit of bigotry.  The aged Mary
of Bethany was also marked as a victim; but her seizure
was deferred until Amaziah and his family should be
secured, as Javan knew that they were in the constant
habit of visiting her, and would take alarm if any
outrage were offered to her.  He repaired himself to her
dwelling late one evening; and with all his detestation
of her sect, he could not help being impressed by what
he saw and heard.  The venerable disciple was reposing
on her couch when he entered, and Hannah was engaged
in reading to her from a roll of parchment, that.
contained a copy of the Gospel according to St. Matthew
Her eyes were dim, and she could no longer pursue her
favourite occupation of perusing the sacred record; but
she was listening with devout attention, while her
faithful attendant read to her the evangelist's account of
those events which she so well remembered.  The
expression of her countenance was so full of piety and
resignation, that Javan stood on the threshold, and gazed
a moment in admiration and respect.  Hannah hastily
rolled up the manuscript, and concealed it in the folds
of her garment; for the intruder was a stranger to her,
and frequent danger had taught her to fear her sentiments
being discovered.
</p>

<p>
Mary also was unacquainted with the person of Javan,
but she addressed him courteously, and requested to
know the reason of his unexpected visit.  Javan replied
that he had heard that she was sick and in distress, and
he had called to offer her any assistance in his power, as
he believed that she was of that sect who were despised
and neglected by the rest of mankind.  Mary looked at
him with a doubtful expression: she had never seen him
at any of the Christian meetings, and yet his words led
her to infer that he was of that persuasion.  For Hannah's
sake more than for her own, she wished to be cautious
in declaring her religion; and she merely thanked him for
his kind offer, and assured him that she was provided
with every comfort which her situation required.
</p>

<p>
"Do not fear, good mother," answered the crafty Javan,
"to tell me that you are visited and succoured by
Christian friends.  I know it already; and it is because I
would share with them in the good work of ministering
to the necessities of a venerable disciple that I have
sought your dwelling.  I am a stranger in Jerusalem,
and you know me not; but your faith and virtue are
known and esteemed by me."
</p>

<p>
"Are you then a Christian?" asked Mary, with solemn
earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to know more of the Christian doctrines,
before I declare myself to be a disciple," replied Javan
evasively; "and I know that there are few so competent
to instruct me as yourself, and those noble converts who
so frequently come hither to converse with you on the
subjects of your faith."
</p>

<p>
"Are you then acquainted with my friends?  To
which of them do you allude particularly?" inquired
Mary, with guarded anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"I speak of Amaziah and his excellent wife and son;
and also of their niece, the lovely daughter of Zadok.
She also has received the faith of Jesus of Nazareth.
Am I not right?"
</p>

<p>
"Now may the Lord Jesus pardon you," said Mary,
"if you are deceiving me, and seeking the hurt of those
who have shown me kindness.  I cannot deny what you
already seem to know, that the family of Amaziah
became acquainted with me during their constant
residence in this neighbourhood; and though I am poor
and solitary, they have ever shown themselves my friends.
If I knew their religious opinions, I would not tell
them to a stranger, who may have evil motives for the
inquiry; but for myself I freely own that I am a believer
in the holy Jesus, and I glory in the declaration."
</p>

<p>
"You are too cautious, my worthy friend," said Javan.
"Why should you suspect me?  I have known the
sentiments of your benefactors for some time, and I
have not injured them, though you must be aware how
ready our rulers are to receive information of any who
follow that persuasion, and to inflict severe punishment
on them.  Confide in me without apprehension,
and remember, that by your instructions you may
benefit my soul.  That roll of a book which your
domestic was reading, and which seemed so deeply to
engross your attention&mdash;was it not a copy of the sacred
records of your religion?  I know it was, and I entreat
you to allow me to see it.  I have long wished for such
an opportunity of acquiring more accurate information
concerning those wonderful things that are related of
the holy Jesus of Nazareth."
</p>

<p>
Mary was entirely without guile herself, and she had
for so many years lived separate from the world, that
she had forgotten to be suspicious.  Even the troubles
and persecutions which she had witnessed, and in some
degree shared, had not taught her any great degree of
what is called worldly prudence, or dimmed the pure
flame of universal love and charity, that had been lighted
by the reflection of the perfect pattern of her Lord and
Master.  To honour Him, and to do good to the souls
of her fellow-creatures, were the first objects of her life;
and in the attainment of these objects she was ready to
endure danger, suffering, and even death.  She was not
entirely satisfied of the sincerity of her strange visitor,
and she suspected that her conduct had been watched
by spies for some time past; but she would not seek to
conceal her faith when it was possible to glorify her
Redeemer, or enlighten the spirit of an inquiring sinner.
Her own safety was not to be put in the balance with
such considerations, but she was resolved that nothing
should induce her to betray her friends.
</p>

<p>
She turned to Hannah, who sat in fear and trembling,
listening to the conversation of the deceitful Javan, and
said, "My daughter, give me the blessed volume which
it is your privilege to read.  Oh that in time the truths
it contains may enter your heart, and dispel all the
clouds of error and prejudice that dwell there.  You may
retire now, for I wish to speak to this young disciple in
private.  It is better," she added addressing Javan, as
Hannah hastily left the room, "it is better to dismiss
that simple creature.  She is well-intentioned; but we
must not trust any one too unreservedly in these days.
You might be sorry to have it known that you confessed
yourself a Christian, even to the aged and despised Mary
of Bethany."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, my good friend," replied Javan, "for
your care of my safety: trust me to be as watchful of
yours.  Now give me the book, and point out to me the
most striking portions that I may read, and my faith
may be confirmed."
</p>

<p>
Mary did as he required, and Javan read aloud many
of the most deeply interesting passages in the inspired
narrative, while his aged companion commented on the
words he read, and endeavoured to impress the spirit
of them on his heart.  The beautiful simplicity of the
language, the sublime purity of the doctrines, and the
marvellous nature of the events which he read, had
power to engage his attention and delight his mind;
but alas! so strongly were the chains of bigotry and
error riveted on his soul, that even the words of inspiration
did not shake them off: and while he sat by the bedside
of the dying saint, and heard her tell of all that the
Lord had done for her soul, and saw her faith and hope
and love, even then he was devising a way to deliver
her into the hands of the Pharisees and priests, and
make her a victim to their cruelty.  He was the agent
of Satan, while he believed himself the servant of God.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
</h3>

<p>
Hannah hastily left the chamber in which Mary and
Javan were conversing, and her benevolent mistress
rejoiced that her little scheme for withdrawing her from
the notice of the inquisitive stranger had succeeded.
She hoped that he would regard her merely as a
common domestic, whose part it was to attend and read to
her employer, but who might take no part in her
religious opinions, and be no object for his persecution,
should such be the evil intention which brought him to
the house.  But it was not to secure her own safety
alone that Hannah so instantly obeyed her beloved
mistress.  She did not abandon her to danger, and seek
to avoid sharing it.  The faithful creature fled from the
house; and though it was now the second watch of the
night, and the dim light of the twinkling stars was all
that remained to guide her feet, she hurried down the
Mount of Olives, crossed the valley, and in a surprisingly
short time reached a small postern gate in the wall of
the city, that opened into a passage leading immediately
to Zadok's house.
</p>

<p>
The great gates of the city had been closed and
guarded at the usual hour; and Hannah knew that she
should have great difficulty in obtaining an entrance by
presenting herself at any of them.  But she had
frequently passed through this private door, on errands
from Mary to her friends Amaziah and Judith, and she
believed that they possessed the means of opening it at all
hours; she therefore called loudly on the name of one of
their domestics, and was quickly heard and answered.
She requested permission to see Judith immediately;
and as Zadok had put no restrictions on his brother's
family, and allowed them to receive whom they would in
their own apartments, she was led without delay to the
room where they were assembled.
</p>

<p>
They were engaged in evening prayer when Hannah
entered.  Her presence did not disturb their devotions;
and the Christian servant knelt with them, and joined
her prayers to theirs.  Amaziah was concluding his
customary act of worship, by imploring the blessing and
protection of the Lord on themselves, and all their
brethren of the church of Christ; and also that it would
please him to turn the hearts of their enemies and
persecutors, to pardon those who sought to injure them,
and to bring them also to a knowledge of salvation.
When the little congregation rose from their knees,
Hannah exclaimed, "May our prayers be heard for my
holy and beloved mistress, and for you, my excellent
benefactors!  I have come from Bethany, at this late
hour, to tell you that the enemies of our blessed Master
are surely contriving the hurt of his servants; and to
entreat you to take measures for the safety of your own
family and the venerable Mary.  For some days past
our usually solitary dwelling has been frequented by
strangers.  Some of them have seen and conversed with
my mistress: she did not commit herself to them, but
they must have seen by her piety and cheerful resignation
that she was a Christian.  Others I contrived to
send away, and told her not.  I have heard, and
probably you have heard it also, that several of our
brethren who, like myself, yet tarried in the neighbourhood,
poor and forgotten, or dwelt as Naomi does with
their unconverted relatives, have been searched for, and
taken captive; and this very evening a stranger of dark
and mysterious aspect has come to our house.  He
entered unbidden, and found me reading the blessed
book, he tried to make Mary believe that he was
partly convinced of the truth of our holy faith, and
sought to be further instructed; and I fear she believed
him, for she professed her belief in Jesus, and even put
into his hands the volume which I had endeavoured to
conceal.  He used various arts to make her declare all
she knew of you, Amaziah, and your excellent family; but
this she would not do.  I left the deceiver&mdash;for such I
am convinced he is&mdash;still talking to her, and perusing
the book which she delivered to him.  I heard him
reading the sacred words of inspiration as I left the
house; and I have now hurried to you for counsel and
assistance."
</p>

<p>
"Was the stranger young?" interrupted Claudia,
eagerly: "was he tall and pale, with sunken eyes, and
dark contracted brows?  Oh, my fearful heart tells me
who he was!"
</p>

<p>
"You have described him exactly," replied Hannah;
"and, strange as it may appear, there was an
expression in his countenance when he smiled that
reminded me of the lovely lady Naomi, and almost
charmed away my suspicions.  But I knew that he
was a traitor at heart."
</p>

<p>
"It must be Javan!" exclaimed Claudia; "I know
that he will bring evil upon us yet.  Oh that we were
safe beyond the reach of his malice!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Claudia," said Theophilus, "do not suffer
your apprehensions thus to prevail over your better
judgment.  I cannot believe that Javan would really
seek to injure his nearest relatives.  I know that some
of our brethren have lately been apprehended, and my
father has used great influence in their favour&mdash;I hope
with success; but I have not heard that Javan was in
any way concerned in their discovery; and his manner
has been as friendly since our unhappy disagreement as
it was before, so that I believe it has not really affected
his feelings."
</p>

<p>
"You look on every one as possessing your own open,
generous spirit, Theophilus.  I think I know Javan
better than you do, and I would not trust his specious
hypocritical appearance of friendship for one moment.
Dear Judith, will you not share my fears?  It is for
Theophilus that I tremble, for I am convinced that
Javan's enmity is strongly excited against him."
</p>

<p>
Judith and Claudia felt alike, and while they
communicated their apprehensions, Amaziah and his fearless
son were occupied in questioning Hannah concerning
the strangers who had lately been seen at Bethany, as
well as the visitor who had excited so much alarm on
the present occasion.  They were all aware that Mary's
days were numbered, and they could not bear the idea
of leaving Jerusalem while she lived.  It was impossible
to take her with them in her present state; and it
would be difficult even to remove her to a safe asylum,
should they be able to find one.  They desired Hannah
to return to her without loss of time, and assure her
that they would watch over her safety, and if possible
visit her the following day to arrange their plans.
Theophilus declared his intention of accompanying
Hannah back to Bethany, both to protect her by the
way, and also to converse with Mary, and hear further
particulars of what had passed between her and her
visitor.
</p>

<p>
Claudia would have opposed this intention, but she
knew it would be useless.  She however persuaded
Theophilus to disguise his person as much as possible,
that if he should meet Javan on his way back to the
city he might not be recognised.  He did not return
home for some hours; but neither his parents nor
Claudia had retired to rest, for they were anxious to
see him safe again, and to hear the result of his
expedition.  His communication did not allay the fears of
Claudia.  He had met a stranger enveloped in a cloak,
as he crossed the bridge over the brook Kedron, and he
was compelled unwillingly to own that he believed it to
have been his cousin; and he was confirmed in this
opinion by all that Mary told him.  She entreated him
to forbear coming to her house again, and to desire his
parents to do the same, and also to use all possible
expedition in setting out on their journey, before it should
be too late.  He added that their beloved friend
appeared exhausted, and he had no doubt that she would
soon be removed to her rest.  He had promised her that
they would none of them visit her the following day, as
they would probably be watched; but Hannah was to
let them know if anything further took place to cause
alarm.
</p>

<p>
The day after the events which have just been related,
Mary of Bethezob held a feast in her splendid dwelling,
and the families of Zadok and Amaziah were invited to
it.  It was not much in accordance with Zadok's
sentiments to frequent such scenes of gaiety; but as Mary
was his relative he would not refuse to comply with her
request, and he desired that Salome and Naomi would
accompany him.  This was a trying command to his
daughter for her Christian principles had taught her to
shun all such revels and festivities, and she knew that it
was the practice of all her brethren to abstain from
mixing in the pleasures and follies of the world: but she
felt that in this instance she was called on to obey her
father, as he did not require of her anything that would
directly compromise her opinions; and with a heavy
heart she adorned herself for the feast.  Amaziah and
Judith declined the visit altogether; but Zadok desired
Claudia to accompany his daughter, and she was very
willing to seize this opportunity of conversing with her
friend more freely than she had been permitted to do
of late.
</p>

<p>
About the ninth hour of the day they repaired to the
house of the rich lady of Bethezob, and Javan was of
the party.  He had never appeared so lively and so
little abstracted.  Perhaps he had been successful in his
political schemes, or perhaps he saw a prospect of the
speedy gratification of his religious and private revenge.
He remained so long with his sister and Claudia, that
they feared he did not intend to leave them any time for
private conversation; but, happily, after the banquet
was concluded, he was called away by one of his most
active assistants in forwarding the cause of Simon, and
the two maidens found themselves at a distance from
him they feared, and able to escape from the busy
throng to a spot where they could communicate their
thoughts and feelings unobserved by his keen eye and
quick suspicious ear.
</p>

<p>
The splendour of the entertainment, and the glittering
magnificence of the dresses of the visitors, could not
engage their attention.  Their thoughts were occupied
with other things, and they only felt the emptiness and
vanity of all around them.  They passed through the
marble columns of a beautiful arcade, which was adorned
with aromatic shrubs and flowers in vases of exquisite
workmanship, and hung with draperies of purple and
gold, that threw a luxurious shade on the gilded walls,
and inlaid pavement of costly stones and metals, and
softened the glowing rays of the western sun.  Claudia
and Naomi paused not to regard the beauty of the
gallery; they hastened through the gay and animated
crowd, and sought the retirement of the thickly-planted
garden into which it opened.  When they believed
themselves to be out of hearing of any of the party,
they conversed with freedom and confidence on the
subjects which at that time so deeply interested them.
Claudia related the particulars of all that had occurred
the preceding night, and declared her conviction that
Javan was concerting some scheme of evil against the
whole family, or at all events against Theophilus.  She
entreated Naomi to prevail on her father to be ready to
leave the city with them on the third day from that time,
as Amaziah, she hoped, would yield to her fears, and
consent to set out at that period.  To this her friend
readily agreed, as she also suspected the intentions of her
brother; and she promised that, if possible, he should
remain ignorant of their departure being hastened.  The
condition of the aged Mary then occupied their attention;
and deeply did Naomi regret that she could not
go to her as formerly, to listen to her holy instructions,
and to cheer her declining life by her affectionate
attentions.
</p>

<p>
"Once more, dear Claudia, I must see her.  Whatever
dangers may befall me, I am resolved, if possible, to
behold her blessed countenance again, and receive her
parting benediction.  I have been wishing for some
days to see you or Judith, that I might give you a letter
which I had prepared.  It was merely to request you
would devise some method by which I could accompany
you to Bethany.  I met Hannah two days ago, as I was
going with Deborah to gather fruit in my father's garden
by the brook, and she told me that our dear Mary was
sinking.  I have been very unhappy ever since, for I
feared she would die, and I should not behold her again
on earth."
</p>

<p>
"Amaziah and Judith and Theophilus are gone to
visit her this evening," replied Claudia.  "They knew
that Javan would be here, and that therefore they might
go with safety.  If possible, they intend to remove her
to Amaziah's house near Bethany, where a friend of his
now resides, who, though not a Christian, is a good and
charitable man, and will protect her for the short time
she has yet to live.  They propose to do this immediately,
if her strength will allow of it; and when she is
safe from Javan's malice you may visit her without
danger, for your brother will not know whither she is
gone, or suspect that the good Benjamin can harbour a
Nazarene beneath his roof."
</p>

<p>
"Mary can never live many days, from what Hannah
said," answered Naomi.  "It is useless to carry her
away from her home; but I will go there and see her.
Will you request Judith to accompany me the evening
after to-morrow.  I know that Javan will be occupied
for some hours at a meeting of the elders and priests,
for I heard him make the engagement.  But whether he
discovers me or not I am resolved to go.  I feel sure
that I cannot long conceal my religion from him, and it
would be a relief to me to be spared the effort.  Were
it not for my dear mother's sake, I think I could brave
the worst that he could do; and even death itself would
not be very terrible, if I could glorify my Lord and
Master.  Life has but little to offer me now&mdash;and the
sacrifice would not be great."
</p>

<p>
"Do not speak so sadly, my dearest Naomi," said
Claudia.  "It has indeed been your lot to have many
trials of late, and it grieves my heart to think how lonely
you will be when we are gone, and our dear Mary is
taken from you.  Oh that you could be persuaded to
go with us!  But since that cannot be, and you feel
that it is your duty to remain with those who have not
the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, I believe that he
will send you comfort, and enable you to bear every
trial."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Claudia, I know he will.  It is wrong of me to
feel so much depressed as I do now, but my spirit is
very sad.  I am not afraid of any trials that may befall
me by the appointment of my gracious Master; I think
that, trusting in Him, I shall have strength to keep my
faith without wavering.  But I do dread the spiritual
desolation and solitude that await me when all my
Christian friends, all whom I love in the Lord, are removed
far away.  Once I cherished a hope that my beloved
mother was awakening to the truth; and if she would
listen to all that I could say, I think her gentle, pious
spirit would rejoice to believe the glad tidings of
salvation by a Redeemer.  But she seems to fear the subject,
I will continue to pray day and night that the Lord
himself will teach her: and I will try to hope, and not doubt
His mercy.  Oh if I could be the blessed instrument in
His hands of showing my mother the only way of peace,
what joy, what triumph would be mine!  And then my
father too&mdash;he would hearken to Salome, though not to
me; and he would see the happiness and the blessed
fruits that spring from faith in the Lord Jesus&mdash;and he
too would become a holy, zealous disciple.  O Lord, my
God," she added fervently, while her eyes were lighted
with all their wonted fire, and her hands were clasped
with energy, "grant me my heart's desire.  Let me see
my parents at the foot of the cross, let me hear them call
on the name of thy Son, and then I could share with
them the most fearful death of torment to seal our faith,
and be thankful."
</p>

<p>
"May the Lord hear your prayer, my Naomi, and
avert the doom that you almost seem to covet.  Surely
happier days are in store for you.  You were always
wont to speak to me of hope and courage, and I feel
that I am not able to give you consolation.  In your
own pious and confiding spirit you will find it, when I
am not here to use my feeble efforts.  How rejoiced I
am that your father has consented to go with us to
Joppa!  In three more days we shall, I hope, be safely
journeying thither; and as we are to travel in the same
litter, we shall enjoy many hours of undisturbed
conversation and happiness together; and at Joppa too, we
shall be together and happy.  You will see Marcellus,
and you will find how true is his attachment to you, in
spite of time and absence.  Naomi, if Zadok would
consent, would you be my sister indeed?  Would you
unite yourself to Marcellus, now that he is no longer an
idolater, and trust to your prayers and your instructions
to bring him into the fold of Christ?"
</p>

<p>
A deep blush mounted to the pale cheeks of Naomi,
and as rapidly subsided, while she subdued the emotion
that was excited by Claudia's question, and replied as
calmly as she could:
</p>

<p>
"I will not attempt to conceal from you, my dearest
friend, that if I were permitted to choose my lot in life,
I would rather be the wife of Marcellus than share the
throne of the Emperor.  I loved him as a child; and
when we grew up I loved him still, in spite of his being
a Roman and an idolater.  Now he is a believer in the
true God, and I feel confident he will one day be a
believer also in his incarnate Son.  Should that be the
case, and we should then meet, with the same feelings
of attachment with which we parted, it would be my
greatest happiness to become your sister.  But all this
is a mere dream, and never likely to be realised.  I must
try to banish it from my thoughts, as I have so often
done before."
</p>

<p>
"We shall see, dear Naomi.  I prophesy better
things," said Claudia gaily.  "I begin to see everything
on the bright side now; I suppose for the selfish reason
that my own prospects are so happy and so prosperous.
Three days will soon be gone, and Javan can hardly do
us any injury in that time, and then all will be well
except parting with you.  Now let us return to the
house, for our long absence may be observed, and
remember we are to start before daybreak.  I may not
have another opportunity of talking to you alone."
</p>

<p>
As they rose from the marble bench on which they
had been seated, a slight rustling was heard among the
leaves of a thick clump of bushes very near them; and
Naomi hastily laid her hand on Claudia's arm, and held
up her finger in token of silence.  They both looked
earnestly before them, and distinctly saw a human font
moving stealthily away, as if to avoid the path by which
they were about to proceed towards the house.
</p>

<p>
"Javan!" whispered Claudia, in breathless agitation,
when the figure had passed away, and was concealed in
a distant thicket.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord forbid it!" replied Naomi, with a deep
sigh.  "If he has overheard our conversation, all your
plans are detected, and we are all betrayed.  Javan was
leaving the great saloon, in deep conference with that
dreadful-looking friend of his, Isaac, the counsellor,
when we entered the gallery, and he certainly did not
see us.  But if any one has listened to our discourse it
may be of serious consequence.  Let us hasten back to
my father and mother; and it may be that only the
latter part of our conversation was heard, and that the
listener may not know who we are."
</p>

<p>
At this moment a loud shout was heard from the
house&mdash;the sound of the timbrels and the harps, which
had come sweetly to the ears of the young maidens,
mingled with the sighing of the evening breeze, suddenly
ceased, and were succeeded by cries of terror and
shrieks of pain.  Lights were seen passing rapidly to
and fro, and soon a number of women issued from the
gallery, and fled in confusion through the garden.
</p>

<p>
It was evident that some terrible calamity had befallen,
and Naomi and Claudia hastened to ascertain the cause
of all the alarm.  They met Mary of Bethezob and
several of her female attendants hurrying to the darkest
and thickest part of the garden, loaded with cups and
vases of gold and silver, and rich brocaded furniture,
which they seemed anxious to secure from some
apprehended destruction.
</p>

<p>
"Is the dwelling on fire?" cried Naomi.
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Mary, "it is far worse; it is filled
with a band of Zealots, who are plundering and destroying
all my possessions, and slaying all who oppose them."
</p>

<p>
"Where are my father and mother?" inquired
Naomi eagerly.  "Are they exposed to the violence of
their worst enemies?"  She was hastening towards
the house to seek her parents, but turned again, and
inquired&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Where too is dear little David?"
</p>

<p>
Mary dropped her rich burden, and exclaimed
</p>

<p>
"O my child!  I had forgotten him.  He was playing
in the vestibule just before the ruffians entered.  Seek
him, Naomi, for the love of heaven seek him!  If he
hears your voice he will come to you.  The Zealots
would not hurt him, for it was plunder they came to
obtain."
</p>

<p>
Naomi looked for one moment in astonishment at the
mother, who thus called on others to save her child,
while she feared to return herself to seek him; and then
she ran swiftly up the terraced walk, followed by Claudia,
who forgot her natural timidity in her anxiety for the
safety of her friend.  They entered the gallery, calling
loudly the names of Salome and David.  The din of
arms, and all the sounds of a fierce conflict, were heard
from the grand apartments, but the gallery and passages
were deserted.  They advanced cautiously, still calling
Salome and the child; and soon had the delight of
hearing their cries answered, and saw the little boy
bound from behind the folds of a curtain, followed by
Salome, who tremblingly advanced and exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Blessed be the God of Israel! you are safe, my
daughter.  I have sought you in every apartment; and
when I could not find you I concealed myself in this
place to watch for you.  I could not leave the house
while I believed that you and Claudia were yet in
danger.  But come, now let us hasten away.  Zadok
has promised to follow us as soon as the ruffians are
gone.  He found this poor little child in the midst of
the struggle and confusion, and bore him away in safety,
when all others seemed to forget him.  The sweet little
creature clung to me, and called for his mother; but she
had fled away at the first alarm, and I know not where
she is gone."
</p>

<p>
While Salome was speaking, Naomi had caught up
her little favourite in her arms, and they were all
hastening down the gallery.  They soon found Mary in the
garden, concealed behind the trunk of a large tree, but
looking anxiously towards the house to watch for Naomi's
return with her child.  When she saw him safe, she
burst forth into passionate exclamations of joy and
gratitude, while she overpowered the little boy with
caresses.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you go away, and leave David with the
robbers?" asked the child innocently.  "They would
have killed him, if Zadok had not come."
</p>

<p>
Mary looked at her rescued wealth, and wondered how
she could have forgotten her only child in her eagerness
to save such paltry spoil.  Always a creature of impulse,
she now felt that her child was more precious to her
than even her own life; but another hour might find her
engrossed with some new object.
</p>

<p>
"Where shall I take you to, my sweet boy?  I will
fly to any cave or hole in the rocks to save you.  If the
assassins come this way we are lost.  Salome, guide me
to some safe spot, and let me not see my darling
massacred before my face!"
</p>

<p>
The increasing sounds that issued from the house
seemed to indicate that the combatants were approaching
the entrance to the garden, and the affrighted group
knew not in what direction to fly, until one of the
domestics remembered that a small wicket in the garden
wall opened into a narrow lane on the other side, and
led to the gardens of some of the neighbouring houses.
Mary had forgotten this outlet, which was seldom used,
and was almost overgrown with the hanging branches
of a vine; but she quickly caught at the idea, and ran
to the spot, followed by all her companions.  The bolts
were withdrawn, and they all passed through into the
dark street, and groped their way along, till Naomi
having advanced before the rest, recognised a turn that
led to her father's house.  It was the same private
entrance by which Hannah had teen admitted the
preceding night, and by which also Naomi had so frequently
passed out to wend her way to Bethany.
</p>

<p>
The discovery was hailed with joy, and in a few
minutes the whole party were safely lodged in the house
of Zadok.
</p>

<p>
The noise of their entrance brought Amaziah and his
wife and son to inquire the cause of their hasty return;
and on learning the act of violence which the Zealots
had committed, Amaziah and Theophilus armed themselves,
and went forth with some of their attendants to
render all the assistance in their power.  Claudia and
her friend were rejoiced to see them returned from their
visit to Bethany, and were eager to know how they had
found Mary, and whether they had conveyed her away
to the protection of Benjamin; but they could not gratify
their curiosity until some time had passed in narrating
the particulars of the scene of confusion from which they
had just escaped.  Then they drew Judith away from
the rest of the party to Naomi's chamber, and learned
from her that their venerable friend had rallied
considerably since the last time she had seen her; and that
finding how averse they all were to leave the city while
she remained so unprotected at Bethany, she had
consented to be removed to Benjamin's dwelling.  She had
however deferred the journey until the last evening
previous to their departure; for she desired to remain in
her own home as long as possible, and felt no apprehension
of being molested so long as they were near to
succour and defend her.
</p>

<p>
"You, my dear Naomi," continued her aunt, "shall
accompany us to that beloved dwelling when we go on
that night to bid her farewell, and give her up to the
care of Benjamin.  He will meet us there with a litter,
and we shall have the happiness of knowing that our
aged and declining friend will receive from him and his
wife all the care and attention that she can require for
the short remainder of her days.  I will myself request
your mother to consent to your going for the last time
to see her to whom you owe so much; and even Javan,
if he hears of it, can feel no surprise that you should
wish to take leave of her before her death, as he knows
that you visited her with Theophilus."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, my dear aunt," said Naomi; "my
heart is set upon beholding her again, and I have been
talking to Claudia on the subject.  She says that you
have determined to leave Jerusalem in three days; and
Mary can never survive until our return.  But I am
glad you have hastened your departure, for there is
danger in your remaining here; and even now you may
have tarried with us too long.  I grieve to tell you that
Claudia and I were so imprudent this evening as to talk
aloud of all our hopes and fears and plans, in the garden
of the house we have fled from.  We thought we were
far removed from every human ear, and we spoke freely;
but alas!  I fear we were overheard, for we saw some one
glide cautiously away as we prepared to leave the spot
where we were seated.  I have learnt to be suspicious
lately, and I would that you were all safe beyond the
reach of those who wish you evil."
</p>

<p>
"I trust it will be so ere long," replied Judith.  "I
will apprise Amaziah of your apprehensions; and by
proper precautions I hope we may yet escape all danger.
Tell me what you had been saying, which you fear may
have been overheard."
</p>

<p>
Naomi repeated the chief points of the conversation,
only omitting that part which related to Marcellus; and
Judith was greatly alarmed at finding that so much had
been said, which, if repeated, would place them all in
the power of their enemies.  She did not, however,
express all that she felt; and Salome's voice was heard
calling Naomi to return to the cedar hall, as her father
had just entered and inquired for her.  She ran to meet
him, and rejoiced to find that he and his friends had
escaped unhurt from the combat.  He informed them
that the Zealots had been at length defeated, and driven
back to their strongholds; but not until they had killed
or wounded several of those who opposed their violence,
and carried off a great quantity of plunder.  The house
of the lady of Bethezob was dismantled, and in such a
state of confusion and havoc that it would be impossible
for her to return that night; and he therefore invited
her to remain under his roof until the wreck of her
valuable household property could be arranged, and her
own home prepared to receive her again.  This was
readily agreed to, and the rest of the fugitives having
departed to their respective abodes, all was again restored
to quietness.  But what peace, what security could be
felt in a city which was exposed to such scenes of outrage
as that which had just been witnessed?  Who could feel
that their property or their lives were secure for an hour,
while robbers and murderers could openly traverse the
streets, and forcibly enter any house that offered
temptation to plunder, unchecked by any legal power, and
unchastised by any arm of justice?
</p>

<p>
It was an unprecedented state of society, and never
may the world again behold its equal!  It was civil war
in its most dreadful form.  The city held within its
walls many conflicting parties, and each was animated
by the most deadly feelings of hatred towards the others.
Murder and rapine prevailed in every quarter, while
religious zeal yet distinguished many individuals of each
party.  The blood of bulls and goats flowed in sacrifice
from the altars that still remained uncleansed from the
human gore that had been shed in the frequent combats
within the temple.  None moved through the streets
unarmed or unattended; and a strong guard generally
accompanied any female of distinction who was induced
to venture far from home.  And yet in the midst of all
this crime and misery the wildest dissipation was carried
on.  It was not only in the house of Mary of Bethezob
that feasts and revels were celebrated; the dwellings of
numbers of the rich and gay sent forth the sounds of
music and of mirth as loudly and as frequently as when
Zion dwelt in peace, and none could harm them.  Such
thoughtless levity appears incomprehensible; but danger
had become familiar to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and they seemed heedless of the scenes of bloodshed
that daily met their eyes.  Is it not the same infatuation
that now blinds the eyes of our fellow-sinners around us,
who walk on in a course of sin and folly, and mark not
the warnings that are vouchsafed to them by the Lord,
and dread not the destruction into which they see their
companions falling day by day?&mdash;a destruction more
appalling and more lasting than the death and the
miseries inflicted by the Zealot robbers of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
It was midnight before Javan returned to his father's
house.  When the lawless band had been expelled from
Mary's house, and driven to their own abode in the
temple courts, he was slowly proceeding homewards, and
meditating on the period when he could safely summon
the son of Gioras to enter the city, and take the lead
among so many contending parties.  He hoped that
the presence of Simon would put an end to the lesser
factions, and he determined to use every exertion to
prepare the way for his reception.  He was engaged
with these reflections when his friend Isaac approached
him, accompanied by a stranger in the garb of a domestic.
The streets were dark, but the man carried a lamp,
which threw its light on a countenance well suited to
take a part in the bloody and vindictive scenes that
characterized the time, and had already hardened the
hearts of the greatest part of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
"Javan," said the counsellor, in a low voice, when
they met, "this man has somewhat to relate which
concerns you nearly.  The leaven of apostasy has spread
farther and deeper than you imagined; and vigorous
measures must be adopted to extirpate it at once.  From
the lips of your own sister this faithful and zealous man
has heard enough to prove that she herself, as well as
Amaziah and his wife and son, and the Roman maid to
whom he is betrothed, are enthusiastic disciples of the
Nazarene."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" cried Javan fiercely, "is it really so?  But I
had strongly suspected it.  Naomi is altogether changed
since my absence from the city; and doubtless it is this
foul heresy with which she is infected that has damped
her spirit, and made her what she is.  But tell me, who
is your informer, and how came he to hear my sister
speak on such a subject?"
</p>

<p>
"His name is Reuben, and he is a domestic in the
house of Mary of Bethezob.  This very evening he was
passing through the garden when he saw two maidens
sitting in a retired spot, and evidently deeply engrossed
with the subject of their discourse.  Curiosity led him
to approach, and unobserved by them he listened to their
conversation.  Reuben, repeat to the noble Javan all
that you have already related to me."
</p>

<p>
The treacherous servant did as he was commanded;
and Javan listened with deep interest to the detail of
all that had passed between the unsuspicious friends.
To hear that his uncle and Judith had adopted the Nazarene
faith did not at all astonish him, for he had already
ascertained their opinions, and those of Claudia.  But
Naomi's conversion had hitherto been only a matter of
suspicion and fear; and every feeling of his breast was
excited with painful intensity, as the dreadful fact became
incontestably evident.  His indignation was wound to
its highest pitch when Reuben proceeded to repeat that
part of the conversation which so plainly revealed his
sister's attachment to Marcellus, and the hope that was
cherished in her heart of one day being united to him.
It was with difficulty that the fiery young Jew restrained
the expression of his passion; but he chose not that
Reuben should see how deeply he was moved: and when
he had finished his recital, he merely threw to him his
purse as a reward for his treason; and laying his hand
on the dagger that was placed in his girdle, sternly
commanded him, as he valued his life, to preserve all he had
heard a secret from every other ear.
</p>

<p>
Reuben departed, well pleased with the prize that
had been so easily earned, and resolved not to run the
risk of incurring the vengeance of the dreaded Javan
by revealing the service for which he had obtained it.
Isaac and his friend did not separate so soon; they
retired to the house of the counsellor, to consider how
they should act upon the information they had just
received, and how they should frustrate all the plans of
their intended victims.  The helpless Mary of Bethany
was marked as the first to be secured; and the very
evening on which Amaziah and his friend intended to
place her in security was fixed on for the execution of the
cruel design.  Javan saw that there would be danger of
exciting a tumult if she was taken prisoner on the
following day, when Amaziah would have time to make
inquiries after her, and interest his friends in her behalf.
But the plan which he proposed to Isaac was, that they
should obtain a strong body of men from the chief
priests, and repair to Bethany before the hour at which
his uncle intended to be there with his family; and
when they had ascertained that the whole party were
assembled together in Mary's house, that they should
enter the dwelling, and seize on all the Nazarenes at
one blow.  When this was effected, he felt assured that
no influence would be exerted in their favour sufficient
to procure their liberty.  Javan knew not that his father
was already aware of his brother's heretical opinions;
and he did not doubt that the discovery would at once
sever all ties between them, and make Zadok as violent
an enemy of Amaziah as he was himself.
</p>

<p>
All the arrangements were agreed upon by Javan
and his companion, who fully approved of the iniquitous
scheme, and promised to lend his aid for its execution;
and they parted with an understanding that the council
should meet on the following night, instead of the evening
which had been appointed, and which was now to be
otherwise occupied.  Javan retired to rest that night
with a feeling of great satisfaction at the prospect of so
soon having the persons of his uncle and Theophilus in
his power.  It was against the latter that he proposed
to direct his chief efforts, for if he succeeded in securing
him, his chief object would be attained.  He would
then be enabled to gratify his own evil feelings of
personal malice and fanatical cruelty, and also prevent the
alliance of his cousin with a Gentile maid.  The knowledge
of his engagement to Claudia had greatly increased
his hatred towards Theophilus; and in order to frustrate
the intended connection, and save his family from the
contamination of Roman blood, he felt that any act, however
cruel, would be not only justifiable but meritorious.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
</h3>

<p>
The lady of Bethezob dwelt in Zadok's house, and her
domestics were busily employed the following day in
removing the traces of the incursion of the Zealots.  It
was hopeless to seek any restitution of the valuable effects
which had been carried off, or any punishment of the
offenders; for who could enter their strongholds, and bear
away any of their members before a tribunal of justice?
Javan took advantage of the late occurrence to plead
with great eloquence in the council that evening the
necessity of inviting Simon and his powerful band to
enter the city, and protect the inhabitants from the
violence of John of Gischala and his ruffian crew.  His
arguments had great weight with his hearers; and some
who had hitherto opposed his object, now began to fear
that it was the only step which remained to them, by
which they could hope to check the oppressions of their
present masters.  Isaac was a warm supporter of all
Javan's proposals: he had always inclined to the admission
of the son of Gioras; and he now ardently desired the
adoption of any measure by which the insolence of the
Zealots might be chastised, and vengeance obtained for
the injury done to the lovely daughter of Eleazar.
</p>

<p>
The wealth of this lady, as well as her beauty, had
engaged the attention of the counsellor.  He was a
constant visitor at her house; and finding that his society
was welcome to Mary, he had determined to make
proposals of marriage to her.  The destruction and loss of
so much of her valuable furniture and household effects,
as he had witnessed the preceding evening, had
exasperated him greatly, and excited a strong desire for
revenge against the aggressors; but he knew that her
possessions in land and money were so great as to render
the injury easily reparable, and he made up his mind no
longer to delay his proposals.
</p>

<p>
The council being almost unanimous on the subject
of Simon, Javan next informed them of the discovery he
had made of the adoption of the Nazarene religion by
the members of his own hitherto unsullied family.  The
recital was listened to with great interest by the
assembly, who were all exceedingly zealous for the honour
of the law of Moses and the traditions of the elders,&mdash;but
most lamentably negligent of God's eternal law of
mercy and justice.  They triumphed in the proof they
had now obtained that Javan's suspicions had been
correct; and more maliciously still did they exult in the
near prospect of seizing on the objects of their hatred,
and wreaking on them all that cruelty and bigotry could
suggest.  Javan did not wish that his uncle and his
family should be put to death.  He desired that by
rigorous imprisonment and other sufferings they should
be induced to retract their opinions; and he obtained a
promise from his colleagues, that every effort should be
used to bring them back to the true faith before any
extreme measures should be resorted to.  He also
stipulated that his sister should not be captured.  He had
not yet stifled every feeling of affection for her; nor
could he contemplate the idea of his mother's anguish, if
Naomi was to be torn from her, without some sympathy.
He trusted that when she saw the evils to which her
relatives were exposed by their religion, she would be
affrighted for her new opinions, and gladly return to the
faith for which she had once been so zealous.  He
knew not the soul of his heroic sister, or the power of
true Christian faith to make a weaker spirit than hers
meet shame, and death, and agony unmoved!
</p>

<p>
The assembly broke up, after having appointed a
body of guards to attend Javan to Bethany the following
evening, and to obey his commands in all things; and
the young Pharisee then turned his steps homewards,
accompanied by Isaac.  All in Zadok's house appeared
cheerful and at peace, for Naomi had not communicated
her own uneasy feelings and apprehensions even to her
mother; and she exerted herself to appear in more than
her usual spirits.  Never did she sing more sweetly, or
converse with more animation; and so gaily did she play
with little David, and follow his sportive steps from place
to place, that Javan began to imagine that he had been
deceived by Reuben, or that the man himself had mistaken
some other persons for his sister and Claudia.  But
yet the minuteness of the particulars which the informer
had related, and the names of the individuals which he
had repeated, forced him to believe his testimony,
corroborated as it was by his own previous suspicions; and
he concluded that Naomi was rejoicing in the prospect
of her beloved relatives being so quickly removed
beyond his reach, and in the hope that her own share in
their guilt would remain unknown.  She looked so
lovely and so innocent, that he thought she could not yet
have imbibed very deeply those opinions which he
believed to be so impious and so productive of evil; and
he longed to see her again restored to her duty, and
taking a cheerful part in all those Jewish rites and
ceremonies in which he had so often beheld her the
admiration of all.  Isaac too was much struck with her
beauty, her accomplishments, and her amiable manners;
and he privately encouraged Javan to adopt gentle
measures with her, and if possible to conceal her errors
from her parents, until he had himself endeavoured to
correct them by argument and persuasion and even by
threats.
</p>

<p>
Before the counsellor departed that evening, he took
an opportunity of declaring his hopes and wishes to
Mary; and she returned a favourable answer.  She
wished for rank and distinction; and though she had no
particular attachment or esteem for Isaac, yet she
considered that by uniting herself to him she should obtain
the object of her ambition; and as the wife of so noble
and powerful a man, she should meet with more
consideration, and possess more influence than in her
widowed and solitary state.  She therefore consented
that when her affairs could be settled, and her estates in
Peræa disposed of, for the benefit of her son after her
death, she would bestow her hand on Isaac; and the
arrangement was made known to Zadok and his family
as her nearest relatives.  They had nothing to oppose
to her choice, though her suitor was by no means a
favourite with any of them, except Javan.  He rejoiced
greatly in the proposed connexion, as he thought that
Isaac would thus be more firmly united to his own party,
and by his increased wealth, be better enabled to assist
his projects, and obtain fresh adherents.
</p>

<p>
The morning of the next day was passed in completing
the various preparations for the final departure
of Amaziah and his family, and the short absence of
Zadok and Naomi.  The priest had agreed to his
brother's wish of hastening the journey, though he did
not acknowledge the necessity for it, or believe that
there was any cause for apprehension.  He did not
partake in his son's fanatical views, or consider that
the cause of religion would be advanced by cruelty and
persecution.  It was well known that he was devoted to
the Jewish faith, and that he firmly believed there was
no salvation for any who departed from it: but it was
also well known that his soul was full of mercy and
compassion, and that he would not injure those whom he
considered to be in a state of perdition already, and
therefore Javan and his colleagues never confided their
schemes against the Nazarenes to him.  His violent
anger at the discovery of his daughter's conversion to
Christianity had subsided into a milder feeling of
disappointed love and sorrow.  He could not continue to
treat with harshness the affectionate and dutiful child,
who had always been the object of his pride and hopes,
and who now sought by every means in her power to
win back his love and merit his approbation.  The one
only subject on which she refused to listen to his
authority, was her new religion; and on that subject
she always replied to him with such gentleness and
humility, and yet with such a holy zeal and firmness,
that he was constrained to admire even while he sharply
rebuked her.  She had been restored to her accustomed
place in the family on the return of Javan, and had
gradually resumed much of her influence over her
parents.  In all customs and ceremonies that were
indifferent she conformed to the practice of her family,
but in the retirement of her own chamber she followed
the manner of worship which she had learned so highly
to prize, and perused with untiring attention some
portions of the Gospels, which she had copied while at
Pella from the precious manuscripts possessed by some
of her Christian brethren residing there.  No alteration
was perceptible to those who frequented the house,
except that Naomi was more amiable, more obliging,
and more gentle in her temper and disposition than
formerly.  The contemplation of her lovely character,
which so beautifully reflected the graces of the Christian
model, tended greatly to soften the severity of Zadok's
prejudices against the Nazarenes; and for her sake he
would have been unwilling to join in any act of oppression
towards those whom she loved as her kindred, and
more especially those who were united to her by the ties
both of near relationship and a common faith.  He
rejoiced that his brother was about to remove from
Jerusalem, for he hoped that when Naomi was left
alone, and entirely deprived of the society of Christians,
she would probably be induced to relinquish her
newly adopted opinions; and therefore he the more
readily lent his aid to the hasty completion of the
arrangements.
</p>

<p>
Mules and horse-litters were prepared, and a strong
body of the domestic servants of both Zadok and Amaziah
were furnished with arms, and appointed to act as
guards to the party.  A messenger was also dispatched
to Joppa in search of Rufus, to request, if he were
already there, that he would send the promised band
of soldiers to meet them at Lydda on the day now fixed
for their journey, instead of that more distant day which
had been at first appointed.  The baggage was all
packed, and everything was ready; nothing remained
but to bid farewell to Mary of Bethany, and consign her
to the care of Benjamin.
</p>

<p>
Judith informed Zadok of their intention to visit their
old and beloved friend on that evening, and earnestly
requested that Naomi might be permitted to accompany
them.  She urged that it would be the last time that
she should have it in her power to lead her niece to
receive the blessing of that holy woman, which, whether
she were a Jew or a Nazarene, could surely bring no
evil on her head; and it would be a grief to Naomi if a
friend whom she respected and loved so much were to
die without her having seen her once more.  The priest
almost shuddered at the idea of his child receiving the
benediction of one whom he knew to have been so
devoted an attendant and disciple of Jesus of Nazareth;
but he remembered that Naomi had already chosen her
lot with his followers, and that one more interview with
her former instructor could have no particular influence
over her opinions.  He therefore gave his consent,
though unwillingly, and only on condition that Naomi
should solemnly promise never again to make any
attempt at seeing Mary after her return from Joppa.
</p>

<p>
Javan had absented himself from home nearly the
whole day, to Naomi's great relief; and towards sunset
she joined her uncle and his family, and all together
proceeded by the well-known path up the Mount of
Olives towards Bethany.  As a proper precaution in
case of Javan's having actually discovered their
intention, Amaziah took with him several well-armed
servants, and he and Theophilus were furnished with
swords and daggers.  They arrived at the dwelling of
their friend, and entered as they were accustomed to do,
without knocking, leaving the armed domestics to watch
at the entrance.  The first objects that met their view
filled them with apprehensions that the venerable saint
had already departed, and that their farewell visit was
too late.  Hannah was kneeling by the couch on which
Mary was laid; and as the door opened, she turned,
and held up her finger in token of silence.  The tears
were rolling down her cheeks, and sorrow was strongly
depicted in her countenance.  Judith and Naomi stepped
lightly and quickly to the bedside, and Hannah drew
aside the curtain that shaded the dying Christian from
the light of a lamp that was suspended from the ceiling.
Then they saw that life was not yet extinct, but was
ebbing gently and swiftly away.  Judith beckoned to
her husband, and he with his son and Claudia advanced,
with noiseless steps, and they all stood silently to gaze
on that form which they perceived would ere long be
seen no more on earth Mary's eyes were closed, and
the pallid hue of death was on her cheek.  So motionless,
so calm she lay, that but for the deep and heavy
breathing and a slight movement of her parted lips, it
might have seemed that she was already dead.  But her
spirit was conscious still, and she was praying at that
moment that she might yet be spared to see her
expected and well-beloved friends, and bless them before
her death; yet her bodily senses were deadened, and
she did not perceive that her prayer was already
granted.
</p>

<p>
Presently she opened her eyes, and was casting
anxious look towards the door, when she beheld all those
she so ardently desired to see, standing around her, and
in a weak and faltering voice she exclaimed, "Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace!  My children,
my beloved children in the Lord, this is a blessing that
I had scarcely hoped for.  The day has seemed long to
me, for I knew that it must close ere my dying eyes
could look on you; and I feared this heart would cease
to beat before the time appointed for your coming.
But the Lord who has supported and blessed me all my
days, has heard my last request.  Come near, that I
may bless you all."  They gathered closely round her,
and knelt in reverential silence, while she moved her
trembling hands, and laid them in succession on their
heads.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my Redeemer," she said, "thou who didst
suffer death in all its agonies, that thou mightest take
away its sting from those who believe in thee, in the
hearing of these thy servants I would testify thy power
to vanquish the last enemy, and make the dark valley of
the shadow of death light and glorious by thy presence.
Leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation,
and may the last words I utter bear witness to thy
love.  Bless with thy choicest blessings these thy
children, whom thou hast called to the knowledge of thy
name; and of thy great mercy keep them in the way of
everlasting life.  May their course in this world be
happy, if it be for their eternal good.  But if thou seest
that trials and sorrows are needful for them, oh strengthen
and support them, and make them more than conquerors
over every temptation and every spiritual foe.  And when,
their mortal race is run, and the crown of immortality is
on their brow, may we meet and rejoice together around
thy throne, and sing thy praise for evermore, for thou
hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, and to thy name
be all the glory!"
</p>

<p>
"Amen," replied the kneeling disciples with one heart
and one voice, while they bent their heads in deep
devotion, and tears, which were not of sorrow, flowed from
every eye.
</p>

<p>
At this moment a loud noise was heard near the
entrance, as of armed men struggling to force open the
door, and horrid imprecations were uttered against those
who opposed them.  Mary shuddered, and turned her
dying eyes with intense anxiety to inquire the cause of
this untimely violence, while Amaziah and Theophilus
sprang on their feet, and drawing their swords prepared
to resist the intrusion.  It was a moment of awful
suspense; but soon the door was burst open, and several
men rushed in with swords and poniards, followed by
the servants of Amaziah, who had vainly endeavoured to
prevent their entrance.  The spectacle that met their
view was able to check the progress even of these
ruffians&mdash;and they stood transfixed to the spot, looking
with awe and admiration on the expiring saint, and the
lovely girls who, with Judith and Hannah, still knelt by
her side, and strove to overcome their own fears and
support their sinking friend.
</p>

<p>
"Behold," said Amaziah, "the victim you come to
seek: she is beyond the reach of human cruelty.  Her
spotless soul is winging its way to the presence of its
God and Father, to bear testimony against those whose
violence disturbed the last moments of its abode on
earth."
</p>

<p>
"Say not so," murmured Mary faintly; "my dying
voice shall plead for their pardon, in the words of Him
who died for them, 'Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do!'"
</p>

<p>
A smile of pure benevolence and holy joy lighted up
her countenance, and then faded away like the last rays
of the setting sun on the cold surface of a wreath of
snow.  All was still&mdash;and friends and foes forgot for a
moment all other feelings, in the contemplation of the
awful change.  Death looked beautiful on her placid
features, which were as calm as those of a sleeping
infant.
</p>

<p>
"She is not dead, but sleepeth," said Amaziah, in
tone of deep solemnity.  "May we die the death of the
righteous, and may our last end be like hers!"
</p>

<p>
The evil intentions of the ruffian band had been
checked, but not destroyed.  The wonder and awe
which had held them motionless had passed away; and
again they grasped their weapons, and looked for orders
towards their leaders.  These were two powerful-looking
men, in complete disguise, their faces being entirely
concealed, and themselves clothed in an uncouth and
foreign garb.  They had not entered the apartment at
the same time with their attendants, but remained at
the entrance in conflict with some of Amaziah's servants,
whom they succeeded in disarming, and then joined the
rest of their band, as their intended victim uttered her
last words of pious intercession.
</p>

<p>
One of these strangers turned away, and his manly
form trembled for a moment with emotions that he
sought to suppress; but the other called to his men in
a stern voice to do their errand, and not be affrighted
from their duty to God and man by the corpse of an
accursed Nazarene.  The impious appellation seemed to
recall his comrade from his momentary weakness, and
he rushed forward towards Theophilus with his sword
uplifted, and already stained with blood from the conflict
which had preceded his entrance.  Claudia saw the
fierce advance, and knew that it could be no other than
Javan, who thus singled out her beloved Theophilus as
the object of his rage.  She forgot all other feelings in
terror for the safety of him she loved, and springing
forward, she placed herself before him, and cried:
</p>

<p>
"Javan, if blood be your object, shed mine: I am a
Roman maid, allied to your bitterest enemies.  But seek
not to take the life of your countryman, your relative,
and the ornament of your house."
</p>

<p>
The stranger was startled, but he spoke not.  He
wished not to confirm the suspicions of Claudia, by letting
her hear his voice, but seizing her arm, he flung her
aside; and as Theophilus caught her and prevented her
from falling to the ground, he aimed a blow at his
shoulder, and inflicted a wound that entirely disabled
him.  The blood flowed over the dress of Claudia, and
all her sudden courage forsook her.  She fainted away,
and Theophilus was forced to relinquish her to the care
of Naomi, and endeavour feebly to defend himself from
the assaults of Javan.  Meanwhile the chamber of death
had become the scene of a furious conflict.  The servants
of Amaziah fought valiantly against a superior force, to
defend their master and his family; while their foes
endeavoured to secure them captives, and not to take
their lives.  Amaziah and Theophilus loudly called on
the women to escape from the house by the back entrance,
while they kept the assailants at bay; but Claudia's
helpless condition, and anxiety for the fate of their
defenders, kept them in the room.  They stood by the
bed of the lifeless Mary, on which they had laid Claudia
also, now apparently as inanimate as their departed
friend, and utterly unconscious of all that was going-on
around her.  Perhaps it was well for her that she
was so, though she only awaked to a sense of utter
misery.
</p>

<p>
The attacks of Javan and his comrade were evidently
directed principally towards Theophilus; and at length
while his father and the servants were occupied with the
rest of the band, they succeeded in securing him,
exhausted as he was with exertion and loss of blood.  They
hastily bound him with a strong rope, and endeavoured
to drag him from the house by the back entrance, near
which they had seized and overpowered him; but Naomi
saw their intent, and loudly calling to her uncle for aid
she flew to her cousin, and rendered desperate by excitement
and alarm, she employed her strength so well as to
impede the design of Javan, and enable Amaziah to
come to the rescue Judith and Hannah stood in the
way, and sought to close and bolt the door; but what
could the efforts of weak and terrified women avail
against the power and resolution of a band of armed
and cruel men?  Several of Amaziah's servants were
bounded, and those who were not disabled could no
longer maintain the unequal contest.  They saw that
their master was in danger of being made a prisoner as
well as Theophilus, and they exerted all their courage
and strength for his preservation and that of his son.
The struggle was violent and well maintained; but alas! the
faithful domestics only succeeded in disengaging
Amaziah from the grasp of the ruffians, and Theophilus
was borne away.  His father would have followed the
retreating steps of the ruffians, but his servants forcibly
detained him, as they were convinced that such an
attempt would only lead to his own capture; and in
grief and horror the afflicted family stood by the corpse
of Mary and the senseless form of Claudia, to consider
what steps should be taken for the safety of the unhappy
Theophilus.
</p>

<p>
To hasten back to the city, and employ all their
influence with Zadok and his powerful friends, was the
first impulse; but what could they do with Claudia, in
her present helpless state, or how should they inform her
of the calamity which had befallen them all?  While
they prepared some rude contrivance to carry her with
them, she revived, and her first words were to inquire
for Theophilus.
</p>

<p>
"He is gone to the city, my daughter," replied
Judith; "and there I hope we shall soon see him safe
and free."
</p>

<p>
"But he was wounded," said Claudia, confusedly:
"I felt the warm blood flow on my cheek.  Why is he
gone away? he would not have left me senseless.  But
I remember now&mdash;oh, the dreadful truth comes over
my brain!  Javan has forced him away, and Javan will
destroy him.  I always knew that he would bring
desolation into my heart; and it is done!"
</p>

<p>
A flood of tears somewhat relieved her bursting grief,
and then she wildly sprang up, and cried,
</p>

<p>
"But why do we tarry here?  Come, Naomi, we will
fly to the city, and with my dear adopted parents, we
will kneel and weep at Javan's feet until we melt even
his heart of stone.  Farewell, dear sainted Mary!  It is
well that your eyes were closed in death before this blow
fell on those you loved so much&mdash;and oh! if my eyes
are not again to behold Theophilus, I would that they
had never opened from the trance that spared me the
sight of his defeat!"
</p>

<p>
Thus passionately did the unhappy girl give vent to
her feelings; and to her disposition it was a relief to do
so.  Meanwhile Amaziah gave some hasty directions to
Hannah concerning the burial of the deceased, and
promised to send some of his domestics, who were of the
same holy religion, to assist her in performing it as
secretly as possible at break of day, and if possible to
attend himself.  He feared that the priests might hear
of her death, and send to seize on her corpse, that they
might bury it according to their own ceremonies; and
therefore he desired two of the servants who had attended
him that evening to remain with Hannah, and prepare a
humble grave for her beloved mistress, in the large and
well-planted garden belonging to the house.  He further
desired Hannah to linger no longer in that dwelling,
after the last duties had been paid to Mary, but to
accompany his servants to Jerusalem, and take up her abode
with him and his family, until his son could be
liberated, when she should travel with them to Ephesus,
and find a refuge and a home wherever they should
dwell.
</p>

<p>
The afflicted family then left the house, and by the
light of the torches with which they were provided, they
bent their way towards the city.  They were startled on
entering the public road to perceive a band of men, also
carrying lighted torches, approaching towards them, and
for a moment they supposed that it was Javan returning
to make a fresh attack; but the voice of their friend
Benjamin speedily reassured them, and they hastened to
communicate to him the death of Mary, and the subsequent
calamitous event.  It was now no longer necessary
for the kind-hearted Benjamin to proceed to Mary's
house, and he therefore insisted on joining his body of
attendants to that of Amaziah, and conducting him and
his family safe to their home; and in the litter which
had been destined to carry the departed Christian, he
placed Claudia, whose weakness made her almost
incapable of proceeding on foot.  Naomi and Judith walked
beside her, and sought by every argument they could
find to calm her agitation, and persuade her that there
was every reason to hope for the speedy relief of
Theophilus.  Perhaps they appeared more sanguine than they
really felt; but they could hardly believe that if it had
actually been Javan who had thus deprived his cousin of
liberty, he would refuse to listen to the entreaties of his
family, or to be moved by the sorrow which he had
brought upon them.  It seemed too cruel even for Javan,
to deliver his kinsman into the hands of those who would
count his murder a meritorious act; and therefore they
tried to believe that he only intended to detain them all
in Jerusalem, until he had further ascertained their
conversion to Christianity, and endeavoured to shake their
faith by his arguments, and perhaps his threats.
</p>

<p>
They entered the city without difficulty, by means of
the private gate, and were passing up the dark and
narrow lane which led to the offices of Zadok's house,
when they saw a wild and haggard form approaching
at a rapid pace under the shadow of the wall.  It was
the son of Ananus&mdash;that mysterious being who had not
ceased to traverse the devoted city day and night ever
since its peace and prosperity began to fail.  His ghastly
countenance and sad and hollow voice could not be
mistaken.  He advanced close to the litter on which the
terrified Claudia was carried, and uttered loudly his
oft-repeated burden of woe.
</p>

<p>
"A voice from the east! a voice from the west! a
voice from the four winds! a voice against Jerusalem
and against the temple!"&mdash;Then pointing his skeleton
finger towards Claudia, he uttered in a still more dismal
tone, "A voice against the bridegrooms and the
brides&mdash;a voice against the whole people!"
</p>

<p>
Swiftly he passed on, and was out of sight; while the
same boding cry was heard repeated in the distance.
But not so swiftly did the feelings of terror which he had
excited in the breast of Claudia subside.  Her mind
had always been inclined to superstition; and though
she strove to banish the impression that was made by
the denunciation of the wild prophet, yet it sounded
continually in her ears as the knell of all her earthly
hopes.
</p>

<p>
The sad party reached their home, and immediately
proceeded to the apartment generally occupied by
Zadok and his family; and there, to their utter
astonishment, they found Javan, in the usual loose robe
in which he pursued his studies, deeply occupied in
transcribing some portions of the sacred Talmud.  Zadok
and Salome, and their guest, the beautiful Mary of
Bethezob, were also engaged in their ordinary employments;
and all appeared equally startled and surprised
at the entrance of their relatives in a manner so
unexpected, and with countenances expressive of so much
grief and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Javan was the first to inquire, in a tone of perfect
unconsciousness, into the cause of their distress; and so
well did he feign ignorance and sympathy, that they
began to doubt whether it was indeed he whom they
had so lately seen under such different circumstances,
and wearing so different an aspect.  Naomi and Claudia
fixed their eyes searchingly upon his countenance, while
Amaziah related to his brother the particulars of all
that had occurred to them, but they could read nothing
in Javan's features to confirm their suspicions of his
guilt.  He betrayed no emotion, but affected sorrow and
surprise; and so readily offered his assistance in
discovering the authors of the deed, that his parents never
thought of ascribing it to him, though the rest of his
relatives were still doubtful and suspicious.
</p>

<p>
Having acted his hypocritical part with perfect
coolness, Javan left the house on the pretence of making
instant inquiries concerning the fate of Theophilus; and
with a promise to return as soon as he had obtained any
intelligence.  He was no sooner gone than Claudia&mdash;who
had hitherto with difficulty restrained herself from
charging him with his duplicity and cruelty&mdash;declared
to Zadok and Salome her firm conviction that their son
was the cause of the sorrow which had come upon them;
and not only that the barbarous scheme had originated
with him, but that he had been present in disguise to
put it in execution.
</p>

<p>
"He had a companion who also concealed his face,
and wore the garb of a stranger," she added, "but his
voice seemed to be one that I had often heard."
</p>

<p>
The daughter of Eleazar was present, and for her
sake Claudia forbore to say that she believed Isaac to be
the accomplice of Javan; but she had no doubt on the
subject, and she was right in her conjecture.
</p>

<p>
Both Zadok and Salome strongly opposed the idea
that Javan could be guilty of an act of such cruelty
towards a near kinsman; but when they heard the
various reasons which existed for suspecting him, and
were informed of the listener who had been observed in
Mary's garden, they began to entertain the same opinion,
and promised to exert all their influence and authority
to induce him to repair the injury he had done, and
restore his family to happiness again.  The lady of
Bethezob listened with interest and astonishment to the
conversation of her friends, for until that moment she
had not known that she had been associating with
Nazarenes.  It is true she had seen very little of Amaziah
and his family: but with Naomi she had lived on terms
of intimacy, and for her she entertained a great affection.
The idea of any longer concealing from Javan that his
sister had embraced Christianity was laid aside, for all
were equally convinced that he already knew it; and
therefore Mary's presence was no check to the freedom
of the discourse, and her inquiries were satisfied by a
plain statement of the fact, and an injunction that she
would observe a perfect secrecy on the subject towards
all but the inmates of the house.  She was a kind-hearted
woman when her natural feelings were not biassed by
passion or prejudice, and her sympathy was warmly
excited both towards Naomi and Claudia.  She wondered
at their religious infatuation, for in her mind that
all-important subject was a matter of taste and feeling, and
not of deep principle and absorbing interest; yet she
grieved for their afflictions, and those of the bereaved
parents, and would gladly have lent her aid to remove
them.  All that wealth could do she cheerfully offered;
but Claudia hoped more from her influence with Isaac,
when it should appear that he was concerned in the
unhappy business, than from the power of her riches.
Indeed from this hope she derived her greatest and
almost her only comfort; for when she saw how kindly
Mary espoused her cause, and how eagerly she proffered
her assistance, she began to feel that all was not yet lost,
and that through her means the liberty of Theophilus
might possibly be obtained.
</p>

<p>
It was late when Javan re-entered the house, and he
attributed his long absence to the difficulty he had found
in tracing the lost Theophilus.
</p>

<p>
"At length," he added, "I have been successful; but
I regret to say that he has not fallen into the hands of
the Zealots or the Idumeans, who might be induced to
restore him on the payment of a large ransom; but he
has been seized by the arm of justice.  His criminal
apostasy has been discovered to some of our most holy
and zealous priests; and their righteous indignation has
led them to take this step as a salutary warning to others
who may be inclined to the same heresy, and as a wise
precaution to prevent his disseminating the errors which
have perverted his mind.  I grieve for his fate, but
it was only what I dreaded would be the result of his
folly."
</p>

<p>
"Javan," cried Claudia, "it is you who have betrayed
him!  None but you and Rabbi Joazer were acquainted
with his opinions; and the Rabbi had sworn to Zadok
that he would never reveal them.  You have brought
all this evil on your house, and now you seek to hide your
cruelty under the mask of sorrow."
</p>

<p>
"Silence, Claudia!" replied Javan indignantly; "and
remember that though I cast back your passionate
accusations with contempt, yet I have power and influence
which it would be your wiser course to conciliate by
submission, and not thus by your unfounded taunts to
provoke me to use them against the object of your
affection.  But I act from higher motives than personal love
or hatred; and I shall pursue the course which I see to
be for the real good of my cousin, and the honour of my
family, without any regard to the ravings of a heathen
girl."
</p>

<p>
Claudia shrunk away from the look of fierce determination
with which Javan accompanied this rebuke.  She
feared that by her unguarded exclamations she had only
exasperated him still more against both Theophilus and
herself; and she resolved in future to restrain her
feelings, and if possible to conceal from him her horror and
dread of his character, and the personal dislike which
she had always felt for him.  She could not reply to
him, for her heart was too full; but Naomi approached
him, and in a gentle voice endeavoured to move him to
better feelings.
</p>

<p>
"My brother," she said, "do not speak thus harshly
to Claudia.  She is overwhelmed with grief, and knows
not what she utters; and you should pity rather than
blame her.  You say that you have power and influence
over those who have carried off our unfortunate cousin.
Will you not exert them in his favour?  He is your
near kinsman&mdash;he never injured you.  He formed the
happiness of his parents, and of my poor Claudia too;
and his character was never sullied by an act that could
reflect shame on his family.  What though he now
differs from you in his religious opinions?  That is a
matter between him and his God, whom he serves in
sincerity; and before whom he must stand or fall.  O
Javan, join not with those who seek his life; but restore
him&mdash;for I know you can&mdash;to those whose life is bound
up in his life, and let not the grey hairs of your father's
brother be brought down to the grave in sorrow."
</p>

<p>
As Naomi finished speaking, she laid her hand on her
brother's arm, and looked into his countenance with a
look of moving entreaty; her mother, with Judith,
Claudia, and Mary, had gathered round her, and with
eloquent gestures joined their supplications to hers.  But
Javan turned on her a look of scorn, and shaking off her
gentle hand, he exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
"Well may you plead for the life and liberty of an
apostate!&mdash;for the same blasphemous creed that has
marked him for eternal shame has branded you also!  I
know it all, Naomi.  Your guilt, your hypocrisy, are all
revealed.  And here, in the presence of your parents, I
denounce you as a Nazarene.  Nay, cling not to me,
and look not so imploringly,"&mdash;and Javan turned away
his face that he might not meet his sister's sweet and
tearful eyes,&mdash;"I am not going to give you up to the
arm of justice.  Cruel as I know you think me, I will
not give your body to be mangled by the executioner.
For our parents' sake I spare you this; and because I
believe the power of the Lord God will yet be sent to
cast forth the evil spirit that now possesses you, and
make you again what once you were.  But till that time
arrives I renounce you as a sister; and I leave it to your
father, to the just, the righteous Zadok, to take such steps
as may speedily wipe away this stain, and remove the
pollution from our house!"
</p>

<p>
Javan looked with astonishment at Zadok and Salome.
He expected to have seen surprise and horror depicted
in their countenances at the disclosure which he had just
made; but sorrow mingled with pity was the only
emotion they betrayed.
</p>

<p>
Naomi was about to reply to her brother, but Zadok
interrupted her.
</p>

<p>
"Javan," he said, in a tone of calm authority, "the
error into which your sister has unhappily fallen, has
long been known both to your mother and me.  It has
been the source of profound grief to us; and many have
been the prayers which we have offered up before the
throne of the Almighty that he would vouchsafe to
restore her to the true faith.  Hitherto, alas! no answer
has been given, and her soul is still in darkness.  Why
should we have told our sorrow and our shame to you,
my son!  We knew your zeal for the Lord, and we
knew the anguish it would give you to find that Naomi,
your only sister, had been beguiled from the way of
holiness and truth to follow this new and most accursed
heresy.  Therefore we have concealed it from you and
from the world; and, Javan, as your father, I now
command you to follow the same course.  Use all your
efforts, all your prayers to bring her back; but breathe
not her disgrace in any human ear.  I would not have
her despised; and, oh! for worlds I would not have her
fall into the power of my zealous, but hard-hearted
brethren.  She is my child, my most beloved daughter;
and though my heart condemns her, yet there she shall
find a refuge, even though all the powers of earth and
hell were combined together to tear her from me!"
</p>

<p>
Zadok adored his daughter; and this burst of parental
feeling was excited by the sudden fear and horror to
which Javan's words had given rise.  The thought of
his lovely Naomi being consigned to death and ignominy,
as an apostate and blasphemer, had roused up all the
tenderness which he had partially concealed, but could
not banish, ever since the discovery of her lamented
change of religion.  She turned in grateful astonishment
at this unexpected expression of his love, and falling at
his feet, she would have kissed the hem of his garment;
but he raised her up and embraced her with all his
former affection, while he uttered a benediction which
had not gladdened her heart since the time when first
she had offended him, and rebelled against his authority.
</p>

<p>
Even Javan was moved, and Amaziah seized the
moment to appeal to him.
</p>

<p>
"Behold, Javan," he said, "what is the love that a
father has for his child!  Our son is as dear to us as your
sweet sister is to her parents.  Judge then what must
be our feelings while we know that Theophilus is in the
power of his enemies&mdash;of those who would rejoice to shed
his blood, and think that by so doing they should offer
up a sacrifice acceptable to the God of mercy.  Your
power is great&mdash;your talents are respected by those on
whom I believe his fate depends.  Listen then to the
entreaties of your family, and show that you are indeed
zealous for the honour of God, by imitating Him who
is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
kindness."
</p>

<p>
"Amaziah," replied Javan, "I am not insensible to
the feelings of nature and humanity.  I delight not in
seeing the affliction of others; and if I could terminate
your anxiety, and procure the liberation of Theophilus
without compromising my well-known and declared
opinions, and countenancing a heresy which my soul
abhors, I would gladly do so.  But the pure faith which
has descended to me unsullied from our father Abraham
is dearer to me than any considerations of a personal
nature.  Your son is an apostate.  He has cast off the
God of his fathers, and gives to a creature, a mere man,
the honour which belongs to Jehovah alone.  Therefore
is he cut off from his family and his nation&mdash;nay more,
he is wiped away from the book of life, and consigned
to perdition.  And shall I&mdash;a son of Aaron&mdash;lend my
aid to rescue him from the punishment which he so well
has earned?  Shall I be the means of setting him at
liberty, to disseminate his accursed doctrines, and carry
the same spiritual pestilence into other families that he
has brought into his own?  No! by the altar of God I
swear that so long as he cleaves to his idolatry, so long
may he pine in a dungeon; or, if his judges see fit, he
may be torn limb from limb, and given to be meat for
the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field.  But let
him renounce his errors, and seek the pardon of his
offended God by confession and sacrifice, and I will
procure his release.  Amaziah, look to your own safety.
You have narrowly escaped sharing the same fate as
your son; and I warn you to abjure your heresy, or to
flee at once from the city.  Judith and Claudia are known
and marked as Nazarenes; and Naomi too is suspected.
I have power to shelter her at present; but even that
may fail, and my sister may be seized on and offered as
a sacrifice to appease the wrath of insulted Heaven!  O
God of Jacob! what woes have been brought on thy
peculiar people by the impostures of the crucified
carpenter's son."
</p>

<p>
Javan left the room, and retired with hasty steps to
the terrace, where he remained a great part of the night,
pacing to and fro, and revolving many anxious thoughts.
All his better feelings had been excited by the scene
which he had just witnessed, and it was only by recalling
to his mind the sentiments of severe fanaticism that
generally reigned there, that he had been enabled to
banish the rising emotions of tenderness and compassion.
But now he had checked what he considered a weakness.
Bigotry and mistaken zeal resumed possession of his soul,
and all his thoughts were directed to the paramount
object of bringing back his cousin to Judaism, or making
him a fearful example of vengeance, as a warning to
Naomi, to Amaziah, and to all who were in like manner
perverted.
</p>

<p>
He left his family in sorrow and dismay.  Those who
adored Jesus of Nazareth as their Saviour, and
worshipped him as God, were filled with horror and
indignation at hearing his holy name blasphemed; and all
were overpowered with the conviction that no hope
remained of the liberation of Theophilus.  Zadok
endeavoured to speak comfort to his afflicted relatives, by
urging them to use their influence in persuading his
nephew to renounce Christianity; but Amaziah bade
him cease such dreadful suggestions, and declared, while
tears of deep emotion flowed down his manly cheeks;
that he would rather behold his son&mdash;his only and
beloved son&mdash;given up to the worst tortures that the
spirit of persecution had ever yet devised, than hear him
by one word deny the Lord who bought him with his
own blood.
</p>

<p>
No one ventured to raise their voice in opposition to
this declaration of the afflicted but undaunted father,
and with heavy hearts the family dispersed to seek such
repose as their sorrows would permit.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
</h3>

<p>
The sun rose bright and cheerful on the morrow&mdash;that
day so ardently desired by Claudia, as the day of her
departure from Jerusalem, and the termination of all
her fears and anxieties.  But it proved a day of trouble
and sorrow, and brought with it no comfort, no hope.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the morning broke, poor Hannah arrived
from Bethany, with the servants who had assisted her
in depositing the remains of the departed Mary in the
hasty grave which they had prepared for her.  Amaziah
had also performed his promise of being present, if
possible, on the occasion; and notwithstanding the grief
which oppressed him, and the danger to which he
exposed himself by attending the burial of a Christian,
he had in the darkness of night returned to Bethany,
and pronounced a funeral benediction over his revered
and beloved friend.  Then he hastened back to the city,
and was followed shortly afterwards by the weeping
Hannah and his own domestics, who carried with them
all the little property which had been bequeathed to her
by her mistress.  One treasure the faithful servant bore
herself, and that was the roll of parchment that contained
the writings of St. Matthew.  Mary had desired her to
give it to Naomi, with her dying love and blessing,
when she believed that she was sinking, and should not
live to see her face on that sad night which had left such
traces of sorrow on the hearts of all those who came to
bid her farewell.  Naomi received the gift with grateful
joy, and carefully concealed it from every eye.  It was
a possession which she had long and earnestly coveted,
and she thanked her Heavenly Father for thus mercifully
providing her with the rich consolation of the inspired
Gospel history, at the very time when she expected so
soon to be deprived of all human support and human
instruction.  For the present all the plans for the departure
of Amaziah and his family were laid aside.  No fears
for their own safety could induce them to leave the city
while Theophilus remained a captive; but everything
was held in readiness for the journey, at any moment
when they could obtain his freedom.
</p>

<p>
The day was passed in various and ineffectual efforts
to interest the chief priests and other leading men
in his behalf.  Even Zadok, the zealous and devoted
priest, so distinguished for his own strict observance of
the law, was seen a suppliant for the pardon of the
Nazarene youth; but no concession was obtained, further
than a promise that he should be examined concerning
his faith; and that no steps should be taken against him
until he was proved to be guilty.  And even then, if he
would acknowledge his error, and publicly renounce it,
he should, in consideration of his uncle's virtues, and
the respect which was entertained for him, be liberated,
and suffered to leave the country.  Mary was not
unmindful of her promise to exert her influence with
Isaac, and had his heart been less hard and his prejudices
less violent, her tears and entreaties must have prevailed.
He was president of the self-elected council, on whose
decree hung the life or death of all who were seized on
suspicion of heresy, and consequently his judgment
would greatly affect the result of the trial.  But he was
a bloodthirsty and impenetrable man, with whom power
and riches and political ascendancy were the only objects
of life.  It was to forward these views, and obtain these
objects, that he had stooped to seek the favour of the rich
and beautiful Mary; and it was the fear of losing them
that alone made him listen to her arguments with patience,
and affect to reply to them with candour and gentleness.
He deceived her into the belief that he would be
Theophilus's friend, and with sincere joy she reported
her imagined success to Claudia, whose spirits rose
with greater elasticity than those of Naomi.  Her
judgment was less correct than that of her friend, and
her spirit more volatile; and while Naomi rejoiced to
see her cherishing these hopes, she herself did not dare
to entertain them.
</p>

<p>
The day of trial arrived; and Zadok, in virtue of his
priestly office, obtained admission to the council-chamber.
It would not have been prudent, even had it been
possible, for Amaziah to be present; and he remained
with his anxious and almost despairing wife, and the
kind and sympathising Salome.  Claudia's agitation
during these hours of agonizing suspense amounted
almost to distraction.  She wandered about the house
and garden in restless impatience, followed always
by her gentle and strong-minded friend, who soothed
her irritation, checked her unfounded and sudden hopes,
and again supported and cheered her when sinking to
despair.
</p>

<p>
At length the voice of Zadok was heard in the vestibule;
and all hastened to meet him, and read in his
countenance the destruction or the confirmation of all
their hopes.  Claudia sprang towards him, and sank at
his knees, in such an imploring attitude as if she were
pleading to him for the life of her beloved Theophilus.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, Zadok!" she cried, "tell me if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She could not finish the sentence.  She could not ask
whether he who was so dear to her was condemned to
death.  Zadok looked on her with pity, and replied:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do not abandon yourself to despair, dear Claudia.
Theophilus, indeed, is not acquitted; we could not
anticipate that.  But no sentence of condemnation is yet
pronounced, and time is given him.  His sentiments may
change, or we may yet work on his judges to release
him, and banish him from the country.  Believe me, all
that I can do in his favour shall be done."
</p>

<p>
The latter part of the sentence was lost on Claudia.
She saw that the fate of Theophilus was sealed, for it
depended on his adherence to his religion, which she
knew that nothing would ever shake.  The dreadful
conviction rushed upon her mind that she should never
again behold him, and her senses forsook her.  Sympathy
for her misery diverted the attention of her sorrowing
friends; but they all felt a sickening dread of what
must follow, and envied the unconsciousness of Claudia.
But she soon returned to a sense of the blow which had
stunned her, and none could speak comfort to her
breaking heart.  The parents of Theophilus supported
their affliction with more calmness; but it was not
less deeply felt.  They had learned to look on sorrow
as a necessary ingredient in the cup of life, and they
could meekly bow to the dispensation of their Heavenly
Father, knowing that every event was in his hand, and
that their enemies could do nothing but what was
overruled and ordained by Him.  But sorrow was not
forbidden them, and deeply they grieved for the
apprehended loss of their amiable and well-beloved son.
Javan was present at the council, but he had not on this
occasion taken his seat as one of the members.  He
wished to appear impartial, and forbore to take any part
in the trial of his relative; but Isaac knew his sentiments,
and there was no fear that either he or any of the
counsellors would be too lenient.  The prisoner was
brought forth to answer to the charge made against him,
and accused of heresy and idolatry.  He replied with
firmness and eloquence, and admirably did he set forth
and maintain the blessed doctrines of Christianity.  He
completely denied all the evil tendency with which
those doctrines were charged, and indignantly repelled
the foul accusation of idolatry; but openly professed
himself a disciple of the despised Jesus, and exulted in
the name of Nazarene.  His judges were astonished at
his boldness, but it only made them more resolved to
destroy one who could so powerfully plead the cause of
the religion which they hated.
</p>

<p>
All were unanimous in their opinion that Theophilus
was worthy of death, and had it not been for the urgent
and powerful entreaties of Zadok, the fatal sentence
would have been pronounced upon him immediately.
But his uncle's intercessions obtained for him a reprieve
of one week, during which time he promised to use all
his efforts to induce him to renounce Christianity.  Should
he be successful, the full acquittal of the prisoner was
pledged; but if Theophilus proved obdurate, even
Zadok's influence must fail to procure any mercy for
him.  Isaac affected to plead for him, that a longer delay
might be granted, but it was with so little warmth, that
it was evident his words were contrary to his wishes,
and the undaunted prisoner saw that his fate was sealed.
He was remanded to the dungeon from whence he had
been brought; but ere he retired Zadok approached
him, and embraced him with the greatest affection.  He
whispered to him words of hope, which sank unheeded
on the ear of Theophilus, for he knew that hope was
gone in this world, and all he sought was heavenly
strength to support him to the last.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord be merciful to you, my son," said Zadok,
"and give you understanding and power to employ the
short period of trial which is granted you, in repenting
of your errors and returning to the truth.  I will visit
you daily, and I will supply you with all the holy writings
which are calculated to remove the unhappy errors into
which, through the wiles of Satan, you have fallen.
Now I must hasten home, and tell your anxious friends
that yet there is hope, and that it rests with yourself to
pronounce the word that shall restore you to them and
to liberty."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, dear uncle," replied Theophilus, "do not seek
to deceive my parents.  Tell them not to fear that their
son will act the part of a hypocrite&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Cease, Theophilus," interrupted Zadok, "you will
be overheard by those who will misinterpret your words.
Farewell.  I will say to Claudia that she may yet be
happy.  For her sake consider, and be wise."
</p>

<p>
Theophilus shook his head mournfully.  The name of
Claudia had pierced his heart, but it had not shaken his
resolution; and he steadily followed his guards, who
now came to conduct him to his cell.  Javan did not
accompany his father home.  He dreaded to meet the
reproaches of Claudia and his relatives, and he therefore
allowed Zadok to carry to them the tidings of what had
occurred.  He knew that the part which he had taken in
his cousin's apprehension was more than suspected by his
family, though he had not acknowledged it, and therefore
he felt himself to be the object of their just indignation.
He also wished to avoid beholding the sorrow which he
had brought on them, lest it should shake his purpose;
and he thought himself bound in conscience to show no
mercy to a Nazarene, unless he would abjure his creed.
He would have rejoiced if Theophilus could thus have
been brought to a public recantation; but he did not
hope it, for there was something in his cousin's character,
and in his demeanour during the trial, that told him he
would defy death rather than renounce his opinions.
Zadok was far more sanguine.  He hoped everything
from his own efforts to convince his nephew of his folly,
especially when every feeling of the prisoner's heart
would plead so powerfully in support of his arguments;
and therefore he persisted in speaking cheerfully to his
afflicted family, and vainly trying to inspire them with
hopes which none but himself entertained.
</p>

<p>
Mary had eagerly inquired what part Isaac had taken
during the trial, and whether he had performed his
promise of befriending Theophilus.  She was ill satisfied
with the replies of Zadok; and when the president
visited her on the following day, she reproached him
sharply for not having acted more decidedly.  Isaac was
irritated, but he dared not show his anger, for he knew
the quick and ungovernable feelings of Mary, and while
so much which was important to him hung on her favour,
he thought it wiser to conciliate her by fresh assurances
and unmeaning professions.
</p>

<p>
The lady of Bethezob had taken up the cause of
Theophilus, and she was resolved not to abandon it.
She told Isaac that she knew it would be in his power
to procure his liberation, and that if he did not give her
that proof of his affection, she would break off her
engagement altogether, and never see him more.  Her
will had always been a law to those around her, and
she would never unite herself to a man who refused to
comply with so reasonable, so humane a request.  The
counsellor was greatly alarmed at this declaration, which
threatened the demolition of all his covetous projects,
and the disappointment of all his schemes, which were
founded on the hope of possessing Mary's wealth.  He
therefore began seriously to consider whether it would
not be his more prudent plan to sacrifice the desire of
adding another victim to those who were so soon to
seal their faith with their blood; and by obtaining the
pardon of Theophilus, to secure to himself the hand
and the rich heritage of the widow of Bethezob.  His
selfish cupidity came in the stead of more generous
feelings to make him act the part of a friend towards
Theophilus, and he left Mary with a solemn oath that
he would not rest until he had accomplished all that she
desired.
</p>

<p>
Isaac hastened from the presence of his betrothed to
seek Javan, and immediately informed him of the warm
interest which Mary took in the fate of the prisoner, and
her positive assertion that the union which he so greatly
desired, should depend on the result of his efforts to
release him.  The counsellor had not doubted that his
friend would sympathise in his feelings, and gladly join
in any measures that would bring the wealth of Eleazar's
daughter into the power of one of his own partisans,
and thus forward his grand object of bringing Simon to
take the command of the city.  But Isaac judged of
Javan by himself, and therefore he was mistaken.  Javan
was a zealous Pharisee and a furious bigot; but in all his
conduct, however blamable, he was actuated by what
he called religious principle.  Self-interest had little
weight with him; and though he would have shed the
blood of thousands to promote the imaginary honour of
God or the glory of his beloved country, he would have
scorned to act contrary to the dictates of his conscience
to further the personal views either of himself or his
friends, and therefore he would not for a moment listen
to the suggestions of Isaac.  If his own feelings of
dislike towards Theophilus had incited him to greater
eagerness in seeking his apprehension, he was hardly
aware of it himself; and he believed that he was guided
by holy zeal for the cause of religion, and the preservation
of his family from shame and dishonour.  And now
that his cousin was a captive, and shut up from the
power of disseminating his creed, and also from the
possibility of contracting an alliance with a heathen, was it
to be expected that he would seek to liberate him, merely
to promote the aggrandizement of an individual friend?
He spurned the idea, and assured Isaac that nothing but
Theophilus's recantation of all his errors would induce
him to plead for his pardon; and therefore if such
merciful projects now filled his breast, the only way to
accomplish them would be to persuade the heretic to
return to the true faith, which he feared would never be
effected.
</p>

<p>
This was almost a deathblow to Isaac's hopes, but all
his reiterated arguments were unable to shake the stern
resolve of Javan; and he proceeded to try whether he
could exert more influence over others of the council,
and thus bring a majority to adopt his views.  With a
very few he prevailed, by promised bribes, so far as to
obtain a promise that they would not consent to the
death of Theophilus; but the rest were too much in
Javan's interest, and also too much exasperated against
the Nazarenes, to feel any inclination to forego their
cruel purpose out of regard to Isaac.
</p>

<p>
The days passed rapidly away, and the period
appointed for the decision of the fate of Theophilus was
almost expired.  The morrow would be the eventful
day; and all the inmates of Zadok's house were absorbed
in anxiety and grief.  Zadok had visited his nephew
constantly, and spent hours in long and patient argument
with him, but all in vain.  Each evening he returned
harassed and distressed; and again each day he set forth
with renewed hopes of success in his work of mercy.
Amaziah would have persuaded him to forbear his visits,
for he knew that his faithful and beloved son would
regret that his remaining days should thus be
interrupted, and his own pious meditations thus broken in
upon.  He did not fear that Theophilus would be
influenced in the least degree by all that Zadok might
urge upon him, for he knew that his faith was strong,
and was founded on the Rock of Ages; and therefore
all his hopes for the life of his son had expired from the
moment that he heard the conditions which had been
proposed to him.  Yet he still wept and prayed before
the Lord, with his afflicted wife and family; for he said,
"Who can tell whether the Lord will be gracious to me,
that my son may live?"  It was from God, and not
from man, that he ventured to look for aid; and it was
only in accordance with his will that he wished to obtain
it.  Better far, he knew it would be, that his only son
should "depart and be with the Lord," than that by
sinfully denying him, he should obtain a prolongation of
his earthly life, and lose the life eternal.  Judith had
grace and strength vouchsafed her to join in all her
pious and high-minded husband's feelings; but Claudia,
the poor heart-broken Claudia, was tossed to and fro by
contending and most afflicting emotions.  Sorely was she
tempted and tried; and her faith almost gave way.  Could
it be true religion, she thought, which thus brought its
professors into such straits and sorrows?  Could it be
true religion that demanded the sacrifice of one so good,
so valuable as Theophilus, and led him to choose shame
and death, and to leave those whose happiness was
bound up in him to hopeless misery and desolation?
Why should he not speak the word, and return to bless
her with his presence?  The Father Almighty had
been the author of Judaism, and why should Theophilus
die an ignominious death, rather than return to the
religion in which he had been brought up?  Weak and
inefficient as these reasonings were, they had power to
agitate the mind of Claudia, enfeebled by sorrow and
anxiety.  Her better feelings told her that such thoughts
were both sinful and irrational; and yet she could
not entirely conquer them, or still the repinings of her
bursting heart.  To Naomi she dared not breathe such
doubts, for she felt how they would be condemned by
her stronger-minded and more devoted friend; but to
Salome she expressed her feelings, and even ventured to
propose that she should herself address a letter to
Theophilus, and send it by the hand of Zadok when he paid
him his last visit that evening.  She knew the power
which she possessed over his affections, and she deceived
herself into believing that she was right in employing it
for the preservation of his life.
</p>

<p>
Salome gladly heard her express this wish, and
hastened to communicate it to her husband, who warmly
approved the plan, and urged Claudia to omit no
persuasions which might possibly work on the feelings of
Theophilus, and induce him to abandon his present
determination to brave the worst that the council could
threaten, rather than deny his belief in the Nazarene.
With renewed hopes but with a trembling hand, the
mistaken girl sat down to address her unhappy Theophilus.
Carried away by her own feelings, she suffered
herself to become an instrument in the hand of Satan, to
tempt the being whom she loved so devotedly to sacrifice
his immortal soul for the sake of dwelling a few short
years with her on earth!  How does the father of lies
ofttimes transform himself into an angel of light, and
beguile the hearts and understandings of those who do
not resist his first whispers, to believe that they are
doing God's work, when all the while they are seconding
the efforts of his arch-enemy!
</p>

<p>
Claudia was long in composing her letter.  What
words could she find sufficiently eloquent to plead with
Theophilus for his own life?  At length it was finished;
and many were the tears which fell on the parchment,
and blotted out the words as soon as they were
inscribed; but these tears would speak to the heart of
him whom she addressed more powerfully than anything
she could write: and the epistle was rolled up
and carefully secured with a silken cord and a seal.  She
breathed a prayer for its success as she delivered it into
the hand of Zadok: but at that moment the voice of
conscience spoke loudly to her heart, and she felt a pang
of doubt and fear whether she had acted the part of a
servant of God, and whether the object of all her
affections would not despise her for her weakness.  She
trembled with nervous indecision, and whilst she paused
and hesitated whether to recall the important letter,
Zadok passed quickly from the house, and it was too
late.  Did she not experience a momentary joy that
it was no longer in her power to prevent the manuscript
from reaching the hand and eye of Theophilus?  She
did; but her satisfaction was succeeded quickly by such
agonising feelings of remorse and dread that she could
hardly support them.  Salome could now be no comfort
to her, for she could not sympathise in the self-reproach
which so suddenly overpowered her, as the conviction
pressed upon her mind that she had been a traitor to the
"Lord who bought her," and had endeavoured to draw
Theophilus into the same dreadful crime.  Mary of
Bethezob ridiculed her fears, and would have repeated
all the arguments by which poor Claudia had persuaded
herself to commit the deed which she now so deeply
repented: but she would not listen to her&mdash;her eyes were
opened to a sense of her sin and weakness, and she saw
the fallacy of all her reasonings, and the selfishness which
had led her to prefer her own happiness to the salvation
of her beloved Theophilus.  She would listen no longer
to the voice of the tempter, but hurried away to search
for Naomi, and unburden her oppressed heart to that
judicious and most faithful friend.  She found her with
Judith engaged in humble and fervent prayer for the
object of their anxiety; and oh! how was her spirit
pierced, and what shame and sorrow did she feel, as
she entered the chamber, and heard the concluding
words of supplication uttered by Naomi, in a tone of
the deepest feeling and most perfect
resignation!&mdash;".....And oh! most gracious Lord, while, in
submission to thy will, we humbly implore thee to look
upon our sorrow and turn it into joy, we would yet
more earnestly desire that thou wouldst be with the soul
of our beloved and afflicted brother, to strengthen him
against the temptations that may sorely beset him in this
hour of trial.  May no fear of death, no thoughts of
early affections intrude to weaken his holy resolution, or
shake his faith in thee, Lord Jesus.  Thou hast called
him to thyself.  Oh! uphold him with thy right hand,
that his footsteps slide not; and whether in life or in
death, may he glorify thee, and confess thy name; that
so, if thou seest fit to take him from us here, it may be
our blessed privilege to meet him again before thy
throne, as one who has confessed thee before men, and
whom thou wilt confess before thy Father in heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Amen, amen," responded Judith fervently, while
tears coursed down her wan and woe-worn cheeks, and
sobs burst from her troubled breast.  "Let my son be
safe in thy everlasting arms for eternity&mdash;and teach this
rebellious heart to resign him cheerfully to thee, from
whom the blessing came!"
</p>

<p>
Pale and motionless Claudia remained, until Naomi
and Judith rose from their knees.  She could not bow
down with them, and join in a prayer that breathed a
spirit so contrary to the action into which she had just
been betrayed.  She would have given worlds to recall
the fatal letter.  She now felt convinced that its only
result would be to lower her in the opinion of Theophilus,
and perhaps to destroy his affection for her.  She
ceased to imagine that her arguments and persuasions
would shake the resolution that was founded on so pure
a faith, and strengthened by the prayers of those who
were ready to sacrifice so much from love to the Saviour,
and regard to the honour of his name.
</p>

<p>
"Come hither, my daughter," said Judith, in a voice
of tender commiseration, as she looked on her agitated
countenance; "come hither, and learn to take comfort
from the Source where I have sought and found it.
Your trial is heavy indeed: perhaps it is even harder
for you to bear this affliction than for me; for I shall
yet, by God's mercy, have an affectionate and beloved
husband to share my sorrows; and you, my poor
Claudia, you will, alas! be very desolate.  Nevertheless,
there is one Comforter who will never leave you.  That
'Friend who sticketh closer than a brother' is ever near
to support and strengthen you; and leaning on his
Almighty arm, you may bear even the coming hour
without repining."
</p>

<p>
Claudia threw herself into the arms of Judith, and
exclaimed, "I have cast off that friend!  Oh! my
mother, I have been a traitor to Him, and he will
sustain me no longer."
</p>

<p>
"My child," replied Judith, "grief has caused your
reason to forsake you.  Why do you utter such dreadful
words?  How can you have cast off the Lord, whose
service is a delight to you?"
</p>

<p>
"I have done worse, Judith," said Claudia, shuddering,
and fixing on her a look of such wild grief as
terrified both her and Naomi.  "Do not interrupt me;
I will tell you all, and then you will curse me, and cast
me from you, and earth and heaven will abhor me!"
</p>

<p>
"Cease, dearest Claudia," cried Naomi, approaching
the unhappy girl, who shrunk from her as if she felt
unworthy of the sympathy of one so pure and good as
her friend appeared in her eyes; "compose yourself, for
you are labouring under some painful delusion.  Why
did I let you leave us this morning, and not follow you
and bring you back to Judith?  I thought you were
with my mother, and that her kind sympathy would
soothe your mind."
</p>

<p>
"Why did I leave you, indeed, Naomi!" replied
Claudia; "you would have saved me from this crime.
Let me speak it all, for my heart will break if I do not
confess my sin.  I have written a letter to Theophilus,
and ere this he has received and read it.  I have
implored him for my sake to deny his Redeemer,&mdash;for my
sake to make a profession of returning to Judaism!  I
told him that he would be my murderer if he spoke the
word that would seal his condemnation to-morrow.  Oh!
I said more than all that&mdash;I sought to make myself his
idol, and to cause his love for one so despicable to stand
between him and his God!  He will not heed my guilty
ravings, for he is too holy to be infected with such base
weakness.  But he will loathe me, and despise me as I
deserve; and when he is a pure and blessed saint in
heaven, I shall have lost the only consolation that could
have remained to me&mdash;that of knowing that his heart
was mine until it ceased to beat; and hoping that when
mine was cold in death my spirit might soar above, and
join him in those realms of peace which Jesus Christ
has promised to those who are <i>faithful to the end</i>."
</p>

<p>
Judith and Naomi were filled with horror and alarm
at this passionate declaration of Claudia's.  They grieved
deeply that she should have fallen into such a snare of
the evil one, and thus have added another and a most
bitter trial to those which now surrounded Theophilus.
They did not apprehend that his faith would be shaken
in the slightest degree; but they knew that nothing
could make death so dreadful to him as the belief that
Claudia was wavering and unsteady in the religion
which he had delighted to teach her, and that when he
was no longer at her side, she might sink back into
comparative darkness and unbelief.  The depth and
sincerity of her repentance were most evident to them;
and all they now desired was to soothe and tranquillize
her mind, and to find some means of conveying to
Theophilus the assurance that she was not so unworthy of
his affections as her recent conduct might lead him to
suppose.
</p>

<p>
When by their affectionate efforts they had succeeded
in calming the violent emotion of their self-condemned
and humbled young friend, and convincing her that she
had not sinned beyond hope of pardon either from God
or man, they proceeded to consider how it would be
possible for them to have any further communication
with Theophilus.  Many difficulties presented themselves;
for his place of confinement was strictly guarded,
and none could enter the building which contained his
cell but the members of the council, or those who were
furnished with an order from them.  Zadok had received
such an order, that he might have the opportunity of
holding a controversy with his nephew, and persuading
him to save his life: but no other person was permitted
to visit him, and Zadok had already gone forth to seek
the final and decisive interview.  Javan had full power
to enter the prison at all times, and to converse with the
captives; but how would he ever be induced to convey
such intelligence as they wished to communicate?  He
had absented himself from home almost entirely since
the fatal night when his cousin was taken prisoner; and
when he did join his family, his manner was so abstracted
and reserved, that his presence only tended to increase
their unhappiness, and add to their conviction that he
was the author of all their sorrow.  In spite of all
this, Naomi resolved to make an appeal to him, and
endeavour to obtain his consent to her having an
interview with Theophilus previous to his appearance before
the council on the following day.
</p>

<p>
While the three friends were engaged in this
conversation, Amaziah entered the room.  He had been absent
for many hours, employed in seeking aid from his
personal friends in an enterprise which he had determined
to attempt, but had not yet confided to his wife.  He
feared to excite her hopes by telling her of a scheme
which might probably end in disappointment; and
though she knew that he was labouring to interest his
friends in behalf of Theophilus, she believed it was
merely with a hope that by their means a majority of
the counsellors might be brought to give a favourable
judgment.  This was a very slender hope, and Judith
put no confidence in such an improbable result.  She
almost regretted that her husband should expose himself
so much to observation, and the chance of being
apprehended, when no reasonable expectation of any
advantage could attend his exertions.  Each night when he
returned home she greeted him with joy and gratitude
that another day of peril had passed away and yet he
was unharmed: and every morning when he left the
house another burden of grief and anxiety was laid
upon her heart; for she felt that he might also be
betrayed into the hands of his enemies, and share the
fate of her son, notwithstanding the precaution which he
always took of being himself well armed, and attended
by two or three faithful servants, also provided with
weapons.
</p>

<p>
Amaziah looked thoroughly harassed and worn out
with fatigue of mind and body when on this evening
ha came home from his wanderings.  But his countenance
was more cheerful, and his voice more encouraging,
as he met the greeting of his wife with affectionate
cordiality, and replied to her anxious inquiries
concerning his success, and also whether he had met
with anything to excite alarm for his own personal
safety.
</p>

<p>
"I have been somewhat cheered by the deep sympathy
which is felt for us and our dear boy by all who knew
him well; and many have promised to spare no efforts
that can in any way assist our cause.  But, Judith, do
not hope much from this.  The council is composed of
men who are little disposed to listen to any voice but
that of bigotry or selfishness, and the only member of
that self-elected tribunal who is favourable to our cause
is Isaac.  He sees that Mary is resolved to abide by her
declaration that the death of Theophilus shall be the
rupture of her engagement with him, and therefore he
will give his vote for mercy.  But Javan will not listen
either to him or me, and almost all the other counsellors
are devoted to him.  Let us not despair, neither let us
cherish vain hopes, but say from our hearts, 'the will of
the Lord be done!'"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my dearest Amaziah, I have, by the help of
the Lord, taught my troubled spirit to rest more peacefully
on His decrees, and to feel that all is wisdom and
all is love.  I believe that I can resign my son to the
Lord, and refrain from murmuring; and now my most
anxious fears are for your safety.  Tell me whether it
is threatened, or whether the best and greatest earthly
blessing that God has given to me is yet permitted to
remain and comfort me in the loss of every other?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope and believe that it is the will of God, my
beloved, that we may yet travel on through this wilderness
together, to be a solace and delight to each other,
as we have hitherto been.  But I clearly perceive that
this city is no longer a place of safety for us; and
whatever it may cost us we must abandon it, and seek a
distant refuge, as soon as nothing remains to be hoped
or feared for our Theophilus.  I have been warned by
several friends on whom I can depend, and chiefly by
the excellent Benjamin, that many of the Pharisees and
counsellors have resolved to effect our ruin and destruction;
and that when they have accomplished their cruel
purposes against our son, and the rest of the victims
whom they now design to glorify with the crown of
martyrdom, their next step will be to draw us into the
same fate, while they believe we are overwhelmed with
sorrow, and may fall an easy prey to their malice.  They
know not the power of our blessed faith to enable us to
triumph over every calamity; and to possess our souls
in peace, even when the hand of the enemy is permitted
to press heavily upon us."
</p>

<p>
"O my husband, how your piety and strength of mind
support and comfort me, and put all my evil doubts and
fears to shame!"
</p>

<p>
"And how they yet more abase and humble me!"
added Claudia, in a trembling voice.  "Judith, you
will tell Amaziah of my sin and my repentance, and
plead with him to pardon me, as you have already
done."
</p>

<p>
Claudia's unhappy story was soon made known to
Amaziah; and every extenuation of her fault that kindness
could suggest was added by her friend, and received
with equal consideration by him whose displeasure she
expected and feared, though his regret at the misguided
step she had taken was very great.  He encouraged
Naomi in her intention of seeking permission to see
Theophilus, as the only means of removing the unhappy
impression which Claudia's letter must undoubtedly
produce on his upright and resolute mind; and also as the
only opportunity which might be afforded them all of
conveying to him their last assurance of undying love,
and warm approbation of his faithful and courageous
conduct.  Naomi went to seek Javan, and found him
just entering the vestibule, in company with Zadok.
He listened to her request with a stern and somewhat
suspicious countenance, and demanded for what purpose
it was that she sought an interview with the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
"It is to carry a last message from my unhappy friend
Claudia, and to give him his parents' blessing.  They
know that he will not purchase life at the expense of his
conscience, and before he appears to hear his condemnation
to-morrow they would wish to let him know their
sentiments."
</p>

<p>
"They are already well known to others, as well as
to Theophilus," muttered Javan; "and they may yet
have further cause to rue their folly and imprudence.
Why should they encourage their son in his obstinacy?"
he added in a louder voice.  "Why should they wish
to urge him on to self-destruction, and compel me to be
accessory to the death of my cousin?  I would spare
him if I could, but he will listen to no terms, and make
no concessions."
</p>

<p>
"I never witnessed such firmness," said Zadok, and a
tear glistened in his eye as he spoke.  "That unhappy
boy has made me love and respect him more than I ever
did; even while he has grieved and angered me by his
bold declaration of unshaken belief in the divinity of the
Nazarene, and his determined opposition to all my
arguments.  Truly I believed that the sensible and feeling
letter which poor Claudia addressed to him would have
brought him to his senses, and shown him the folly of
consigning his family to misery for the sake of his wild,
unfounded notions.  But no; he read it with tears, but
they were tears of grief and disappointment, and not of
natural sympathy.  He showed me the letter; and as
he put it in my hand he exclaimed, 'Here is the bitterness
of death, when those who love me best prove false
to the holy faith which supports me!'  From that
moment sorrow took possession of his countenance, and
he would listen to nothing which I was prepared to
urge.  I was forced to leave him far more depressed
than I have ever seen him; and if you, Naomi, can say
ought to lighten the load on his spirit, I will join with
you in requesting your brother to give you an order to
visit him.  He is resolved to die, but I cannot bear
that his last moments should thus be clouded with fresh
sorrow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes!" cried Naomi, "I can chase away those
clouds, and make him calm again.  Dear Javan, do not
refuse my prayer, but grant to Theophilus the only
comfort that can now avail to cheer him.  If I could
hope to move you to yet greater mercy, I would kneel
to you, and weep till the fountain of my eyes was dried
up; but I know it will be in vain."
</p>

<p>
"Speak not to me of pleading for an apostate," said
Javan, "or you may lose the boon you have already
asked.  Were I weak enough to give way to my own
feelings of compassion, my companions in the council
would better know their duty to God and man than to
join me.  The life of Theophilus is justly forfeited; but
whatever may make his doom more tolerable I will
gladly consent to.  Swear to me that you have no design
for aiding his escape, and I will let you see him."
</p>

<p>
"I have no object, Javan, but to act as a messenger
from his friends.  Would to God that they also might
visit him!"
</p>

<p>
"No, Naomi, I am acting contrary to the express
orders of the council in permitting any of his relatives,
except our revered father, to hold any intercourse with
him.  It would only add to their own danger to attempt
it.  If you wish to go to the prison this evening, you
must not delay, for night is closing in, and in another
hour the prison will be shut, and the gates will not be
opened on any pretext until after sunrise."
</p>

<p>
Javan went to prepare the necessary order for Naomi;
and she was hastening to communicate to her anxious
friends the result of her errand, when Zadok recalled
her.
</p>

<p>
"Here, my child," he said, "take this letter to Claudia,
and tell her that Theophilus bade me say he would have
written to her, but he did not possess the means.  He
told me to give her his most faithful love and dying
benediction, and to say that he would try to forget she
had written the letter which had caused him more
sorrow than anything he had suffered since last he
saw her.  He said much more, but my own opinions
forbid me to repeat the language which in his mistaken
zeal he uttered.  You will see him yourself; and I only
pray that his present situation may act as a warning to
you, Naomi, and deter you from persisting in a course
which may lead to a repetition of such misery, and
cause inexpressible sorrow to your dear mother and
to me."
</p>

<p>
Naomi received the letter, and in silence withdrew,
and hurried to the apartment where Claudia was waiting
her return, with Amaziah and Judith.  The agitated
girl listened to the message which was sent by Theophilus,
and took the ill-advised manuscript in her hand;
but instantly threw it from her with abhorrence, and
burst into an agony of tears.
</p>

<p>
"O Naomi!" she sobbed forth, "he does forgive me,
then; but I know he despises me.  Tell him my heart
is breaking, and that the loss of his esteem was the last
blow that was wanting to crush me to the earth."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Claudia," replied Naomi, "he will love you as
sincerely and as fervently as ever when he knows how
true your repentance is, and remembers that it was
excess of love to him that led you to seek his
preservation in a way that your own conscience condemned.
I will go to him, and say all that you could wish.  I
strove to obtain permission for you and his parents to
see him, but Javan would not hear of it.  Farewell for
one hour, and fear not but that Theophilus will be
restored to peace by what I shall tell him."

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
</h3>

<p>
Theophilus sat lonely and sad in his gloomy cell.
Death had not had power to shake his steadfast soul, but
the fear that his beloved Claudia was not rooted and
grounded in the faith had filled him with sorrow.  He
now doubly deplored his unhappy fate, which would
so soon remove him from her, and leave her perhaps a
prey to doubts and repinings.  Had he been permitted
to remain with her, he felt sure he could have brought
her to a better and a more enduring state of mind.  But,
alas! what is the value of a faith that will not stand the
test of trials and afflictions?  If Claudia professed to be
a follower of the Lord Jesus, because the story of his
life and death interested her feelings and touched her
heart; and believed she was his disciple because those
she loved and esteemed were his devoted servants,
would such a faith save her?  Theophilus was now
sorrowful indeed, and his resource was in prayer.  He
prayed for Claudia, that the Lord would bring her
to himself in sincerity and truth, though it might be
with many afflictions.  And while he was thus engaged,
and deeply absorbed in his own melancholy yet pious
and confiding thoughts, a light shone into his dark cell
through the iron grating in the door, and a noise was
heard of footsteps approaching.  The bolts and locks of
the heavy door were unfastened, and to his inexpressible
surprise and delight he beheld Naomi enter.  The door
was immediately closed, and she approached him.  The
greeting of the cousins was silent and very sorrowful;
for all those feelings, which they had each
hitherto to repress, were called forth at the sight of
each other, and the remembrance of all that had occurred
since the sad night when they stood together at the
deathbed of Mary at Bethany.  When they had
recovered their composure Theophilus eagerly inquired
about his parents and Claudia, and listened with deep
interest to the recital of all their grief and all their
faith and resignation.  Still greater was the interest and
the satisfaction which he felt at hearing of poor Claudia's
penitence, and the sorrow which her error had occasioned
her; and most grateful was he that his worst apprehensions
were thus removed, and that he could leave the
world in joyful confidence that she would follow him in
the path of true religion, and join him in a better world,
as one of those who have "washed their robes, and made
them white in the blood of the Lamb."
</p>

<p>
"Oh that I could once more have seen her!" he
exclaimed, "that I might have told her how truly I
pardon her for the pain which her well-meant but most
mistaken effort to preserve my life has cost me.  But as
that cannot be, tell her, dear Naomi, that all is forgotten;
and that the deep remorse she has felt for her temporary
unfaithfulness to her Saviour, proves to me that she
will never again forsake his fold or deny his name.
She has experienced the bitter consequences of allowing
any earthly object to interfere with her entire devotion
to Him; and I pray that His grace may never again be
taken from her, but keep her steadfast unto the end,
even if she should be called to follow me by the same
dark and dreadful road which I must so soon traverse."
</p>

<p>
"I do not fear for her resolution and her perseverance
for the future, Theophilus.  It is not personal suffering
that would have driven her to forget her Lord and
Master, and act as she has done this day.  It was her
fear for you that clouded her reason, and silenced the
voice of conscience.  To save your life seemed to her
the first object; and, alas! she forgot that if she
succeeded in tempting you to comply with the blasphemous
conditions of your cruel judges, the life thus purchased
would be embittered for ever, both to herself and you.
Her eyes are opened now; and she sees and feels that
it is better to lose you here, and meet you again in that
blessed world where you will soon be united to the
company of apostles and saints and martyrs.  But,
poor girl, it is a severe trial for one so young, and whose
feelings are so strong as hers.  May the Lord be her
strength and her consolation!"
</p>

<p>
"Naomi," said Theophilus, "I love to hear you talk
of her; but you must forbear, lest you make life too
precious to me.  Pray with me, dear cousin, and help
me thus to regain the calmness and the courage which I
felt until poor Claudia's letter came to disturb my soul,
and revive the struggle between the flesh and the spirit.
Your ardent piety and perfect trust in God have often
been my example and my comfort in other days, less
sorrowful than this, and now you are come as an angel
to bring peace to my troubled heart.  Let us kneel
together."
</p>

<p>
Naomi with great difficulty commanded her emotion,
and complied with the request of Theophilus.  They
prayed to that Father who is never slow to hear and
answer the supplications of his children; and when they
rose from their knees it was with feelings of entire
resignation, and almost of joy.  Their discourse was
soon interrupted by the entrance of the keeper of the
prison, who desired Naomi to accompany him immediately,
as the gates were about to be closed.  A few
parting words were all that could be uttered; and
Naomi followed her guide through the long and gloomy
passages that led to the entrance of the prison, while
the tears which she had struggled to repress while in
the presence of her cousin, now flowed unchecked.  Her
admiration of his faith and his humility, his tender
regard for the feelings of his friends, and his heroic
resolution to bear the cross which was laid upon him,
only made her regret still more deeply that he should
be thus cut off in the flower of his days, and taken away
from those who loved him so dearly, and to whom his
life was in every way so valuable.  It was one of those
mysterious dispensations of an All-wise Providence
which our understandings cannot fathom, and in which it
becomes us in humble faith to say with the Psalmist, "I
was dumb, I opened not my mouth, for it was thy doing."
</p>

<p>
Zadok had accompanied his daughter to the prison,
and with several of his attendants he now waited for
her in the porch.  The state of the city was not such
as to admit of any person traversing the streets alone
and unprotected, after the shades of night had spread
a veil over the sin and violence that continually defiled
that once holy place; and Zadok also felt a vague
apprehension that the same persons who had so successfully
conspired against Theophilus, might also seek to
rob him of his beloved child.  He therefore had watched
and guarded her with redoubled care ever since her
conversion to Christianity had become more generally
known; and both he and Salome lived in constant
dread of a calamity which they felt would be the
death-blow to all their earthly happiness.
</p>

<p>
Naomi leaned on her father's arm, and they slowly
descended the steep and narrow street that led from the
eminence on which the prison stood.  From that situation
they had an extended view of the lower city, now
clearly visible in the moonlight, and looking so calm
and so beautiful, that it was difficult to believe how much
of vice and misery and crime was lurking amid the silent
streets beneath them.  The sight of a vast assemblage of
human habitations without the sounds of human life has
always something in it that is melancholy, and Naomi
especially felt it so on this occasion, when her own spirits
depressed and exhausted by the effort which she
had made to sustain them during her trying interview
with Theophilus.  The city of Zion seemed sunk in
sleep; and she thought with sadness how profoundly
her inhabitants were also buried in the sleep of sin and
false security, and how, by their impiety and hardness of
heart, and by the oppression and murder of the innocent
they were daily filling up the measure of their guilt,
and provoking their long-suffering God to bring upon
them the fierceness of his threatened wrath.  Her father
did not interrupt her reflections, for he sympathised in
her feelings at parting with Theophilus; and his own
mind was occupied with sad thoughts also, though they
differed greatly from those of his daughter, and were
unmixed with the holy consolations and triumphant
hopes that cheered her while she contemplated her
cousin's approaching fate.
</p>

<p>
The silence was broken suddenly and fearfully.  The
wild deep voice of the son of Ananus made Naomi
start, and a sensation of terror ran through her frame
as she saw his unearthly form approaching with his
usual rapid strides, and heard his yet more unearthly
cry, "Woe, woe to the city! woe to Jerusalem!"
</p>

<p>
She shrunk back, and would have drawn her father
into the shade of a deep archway by which they were
passing; but the mysterious prophet had fixed his glaring
eye upon them, and came directly towards the spot
where they stood.
</p>

<p>
"Woe to thee, Zadok, thou son of Aaron!" he cried.
"Woe to all thine house! and woe to thee also gentle
maid of Zion.  Thy star shall set&mdash;but it shall rise
again."  He turned away, and would have passed on,
but Zadok caught him by his loose and tattered garment,
and addressed him in a voice of kindness:
</p>

<p>
"Come home with me, thou son of Ananus; and let
me give thee clothes and food.  You utter unceasing
woes against our city and our families; but I will return
thy curses with blessings, for it pains my heart to
behold a fellow creature so desolate and so miserable.
Hunger and fatigue have made you mad.  Come home
with me, and cease to terrify the women and children,
and scare away their sleep by night with such doleful
sounds."
</p>

<p>
The prophet looked at Zadok, and his haggard countenance
relaxed from its usual severity and abstraction;
but it was pity for him who offered him kindness and
shelter that made him pause, and not a thought of
relaxing his almost miraculous exertions, or giving repose
to his worn-out frame.
</p>

<p>
"Seek not to detain me," he exclaimed; "I have yet
more woes to proclaim.  I must tell it in the ears of
every inhabitant of Zion that woe is coming!  I see the
gathering clouds&mdash;I hear the distant thunders of
Jehovah's wrath&mdash;and I must forewarn my countrymen of
the coming storm.  Save yourselves, oh ye that be
wise!  But it is too late&mdash;the decree is gone forth!  I
hear it now&mdash;A voice from the east!  A voice from the
west!  A voice from the four winds&mdash;crying, Woe, woe,
to Jerusalem!"
</p>

<p>
He broke from Zadok's grasp with the unnatural
strength of a maniac, and wildly fled up the street till
he reached the prison walls, when again he took up his
fearful note, and woke the inmates of the gloomy pile
from their temporary forgetfulness of care and sorrow.
This encounter did not cheer the spirits of Naomi: she
remembered the denunciations which the son of Ananus
had addressed so pointedly to Claudia, and felt how the
woes which he had prophesied had been fulfilled; and
she could not banish from her mind the impression that
further sorrows were hanging over her father and her
family.  Claudia was anxiously waiting to receive her
on her return, and with Amaziah and Judith she was
cheered, though deeply affected, at the account of
Theophilus's peace and resignation.  His message of
forgiveness and love to poor Claudia awoke all her sorrow,
though it relieved her heart of a heavy burden, and
animated her to resolutions of future devotion to the
cause for which Theophilus was about to resign his
life.
</p>

<p>
The morning dawned, and found the anxious party
still assembled together and still conversing on the same
deeply interesting subject.  The final appearance of the
prisoner before his hard-hearted judges was to take
place at noon; and long before that hour Amaziah left
the house, telling Judith that he was going to make the
last effort for the preservation of their son, but warning
her to cherish no hopes of his success.  Zadok also went
forth with Javan and Isaac, to be present at the meeting
of the council, which was to be held in a large hall
adjoining the prison; and Mary once more declared to
her affianced husband, privately and solemnly, that
if he did not return to announce the acquittal of
Theophilus, she would never see him more.  She had
lately begun to doubt the sincerity of his affection, and
she resolved that he should give her this proof of his
devotion to her wishes, or lose the prize he so eagerly
coveted.
</p>

<p>
The council assembled, and having gone through the
preliminary forms which they had themselves instituted,
the president commanded the Nazarene prisoner to be
brought forth.  Zadok almost regretted that he had
entered the hall when he saw his noble and undaunted
kinsman appear, for his feelings of pity and admiration
were painfully excited; and he knew that it was all in
vain to raise his single voice in his favour.  Isaac
demanded of the prisoner whether the mercy of the court
in allowing him time for repentance had been effectual:
and whether he was now prepared to abjure his errors,
and publicly to acknowledge that Jesus of Nazareth was
an impostor, who had suffered the due reward of his
crimes and seditions.
</p>

<p>
A holy indignation sparkled in the eyes of Theophilus
at this blasphemous question.  He paused a moment to
subdue his rising spirit; and then, with a calmness and
dignity that impressed even his enemies who thirsted
for his blood, he replied:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Isaac, may God forgive you and your accomplices
in this day's guilt, for the insult you have dared to utter.
By his grace I declare that Jesus of Nazareth is the
Son of the Most High God, the expected Messiah, and
the Saviour of the world.  His death was the sacrifice
appointed by his Father before the foundation of the
world, to expiate the sins of all mankind: and it was
brought about by the pride, cruelty, and unbelief of the
Jews, who with wicked hands did crucify and slay him.
I have given myself to Him who died for me, to be
saved and pardoned and glorified by his grace; and
shall death affright me from him?  Oh no; his love is
present with me now, and dearer is that love to me than
all this world can offer!"
</p>

<p>
"Is this your final declaration, Theophilus?" asked
Javan, with a look of great anxiety: "are you so resolved
to perish both in body and soul, and to be cut off eternally
from the portion of Israel?"
</p>

<p>
"O Javan!" replied the prisoner, "I will say to you,
are you still thus hardened against the truth, and
determined to despise the salvation of the Lord?  The
drowning man, who has grasped a powerful arm to save
him from destruction, does not wantonly abandon his
hope; and I have found an Almighty arm, to which I
cling for salvation from my sins, and from their eternal
punishment.  Shall I idly loose my hold, and fall back
into the billows and deep waters out of which I have
been rescued?  No, Javan, no! heaven is before me
and I will not look back.  The final step is fearful to
flesh and blood; but His rod and His staff shall comfort
me.  All the favour that I now crave at your hands is,
that I may be disturbed no more by questions or
arguments, but left alone with my God and Saviour, until
ye come to liberate my soul, and send it forth to meet
Him in a purer state.  From my heart I forgive you
all; and my farewell to you is a prayer, that when you
come to face death as nearly as I now do, you may have
found the same all-powerful and all-merciful Guide who
now leads me on, and gives me strength and victory."
</p>

<p>
A murmur ran round the court, and some voices
were heard expressing pity and admiration for the
young and ardent prisoner.  Zadok boldly pleaded for
his release, and Isaac leaned strongly to the side of
mercy; but they could urge nothing to change the
stern decree of the council, that every convicted follower
of Jesus should be put to death.  The very eloquence
and bold confession of Theophilus only spoke his own
condemnation, and proved how dangerous and zealous
a disciple of the Nazarene they had it in their power
to destroy.
</p>

<p>
A division took place, and loud and angry words were
heard, while Theophilus looked calmly on, for he saw
that his fate was decided.  Suddenly the doors of the hall
were thrown open with violence, and Amaziah appeared
at the head of a numerous and well-armed band: he
looked eagerly round the apartment, and instantly broke
through every obstacle, and springing to the spot where
his beloved son was standing, caught him in his arms,
crying, "I will save you or die, my son!"
</p>

<p>
The tumult became general, for Isaac, without openly
joining the party of Amaziah, used every effort to
increase the confusion, and give him a better chance
of success.  Zadok forgot his priestly character, and all
his former prejudices against the Nazarenes, in the hope of
rescuing his nephew; and he with his arm and his voice
encouraged those who surrounded and defended him.
It was a moment of intense feeling for Theophilus; all
the ties of nature and affection resumed their hold on
his heart, and hope once more revived that life and
liberty might be granted.
</p>

<p>
Before Javan left his home that morning, one of Mary's
servants had requested to speak with him in private.  It
was Reuben, the same who had revealed to Isaac the
conversation which he had overheard in the garden
between Naomi and Claudia, and which had led to
much sin and sorrow, he had now come on a similar
errand of treachery, to betray to Javan the plans that
were in agitation for the rescue of his cousin: he told
him that Isaac had conferred with Amaziah several days
ago, and had promised to befriend his son in every way
that was consistent with his own character, though he
found it hopeless to persuade his coadjutors to pronounce
hie pardon.  Trusting to his promises, which were
secured by self-interest, Amaziah eagerly concerted with
him a scheme, which appeared to give the only chance
of saving Theophilus, though at the same time it involved
considerable danger to his father.  Several of his friends
were induced to lend their aid; and though fear for
their own safety prevented their joining in the enterprise,
yet they placed their domestics and armed retainers at
the disposal of Amaziah, and he entered the hall with a
force quite sufficient to effect his purpose.
</p>

<p>
But treason had counteracted all his plans.  Javan
had taken advantage of the information which Reuben
had deceitfully obtained, and had placed a strong body
of troops in ambush among the walls of the prison,
ready to rush in and attack Amaziah and his followers
in the rear.  Reuben was at hand to summon them,
and when Javan saw that all his uncle's men had
entered the hall, he made a sign to him, and in a few
moments the troops were at the door.  Their numbers were
greatly superior to those of Amaziah's party, and the
contest was soon ended.  The prisoner was secured, and
borne away again by a private entrance to his dungeon,
before his distracted father was aware that all hope was
gone.  His indignation and grief then broke forth with
violence, and he reproached the council with their
injustice and cruelty, in language that was not likely to
pass unnoticed or unrevenged.  Zadok feared for his
brother's safety; and as nothing further could now be
hoped for the unfortunate Theophilus, he led, or rather
forced him from the hall, while the exasperated members
of the council regarded him with looks of rage, which
they were only deterred from openly demonstrating
by respect for Zadok, and fear of offending Javan.
When the brothers had left the hall, followed by all the
band who had accompanied Amaziah, Isaac desired that
the business of the day might be resumed, and that the
rest of the Nazarene prisoners (whose fate had been
delayed until Theophilus could be added to their number)
might be brought up for final condemnation.  The
President had been astonished at the sudden and
unexpected appearance of the troops, whose services Javan
had so promptly obtained, and having also observed the
dark countenance of Reuben among the servants who
kept the door, he began to suspect that the enterprise
of Amaziah had been betrayed, and that his own share
in it might also be known by his brethren in the council.
Such a discovery would infallibly destroy all his political
power, and deprive him of the confidence and esteem
of Javan, which was founded on his character for
religious zeal and firmness of purpose.  To obviate all
injurious impressions which might have been made by
the reports of Reuben, he now resolved to show a
determined severity towards the ill-fated prisoners who
were to hear their condemnation from his lips; and
rather to risk the loss of Mary's favour than subject
himself to the suspicion of being a friend to Theophilus,
or any convicted Nazarene.
</p>

<p>
The entrances to the prison and the hall were carefully
closed and guarded before the prisoners were summoned,
to prevent the possibility of a rescue being again
attempted; and the officers and keepers of the prison
soon appeared leading the unoffending victims, bound
with chains and fetters.  They were eight in number,
besides Theophilus, of different ages, both male and
female,&mdash;some in the bloom of youth and some bowed
down with age and infirmity and suffering, but all
inspired with one feeling and strengthened by one hope.
They had already declared their firm and unalterable
belief in the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth, and no
further examination now took place, except a formal offer
of pardon if they would renounce this belief, which was
decidedly rejected by each in turn.  The sentence of
death was pronounced by Isaac; and the prisoners were
informed that no delay would be allowed, and that they
must prepare for execution at the dawn of day on the
morrow.  They were condemned to be beheaded in
prison; and at the suggestion of Javan a clause was
added that their bodies should be exposed on the walls
of the building, and then carried to the valley of
Hinnom, and burnt in the fires which were kept
constantly burning there to consume the filth and rubbish
of the city.
</p>

<p>
This appeared a wanton indignity; but Javan urged
that it was necessary, in order to prevent the friends of
the criminals obtaining possession of their carcasses and
performing their idolatrous rites at their burial.  A
shudder of disgust and dread might have been perceived
to run through the line of prisoners as they heard their
hasty doom announced, and thought of the loathsome
place to which their bodies would so soon be consigned;
but they spoke not to plead for a reversal of this cruel
decree.  They knew that their fate was decided, and
they did not wish their crown of martyrdom to be
delayed, or to be kept longer from the place of their rest.
Theophilus turned his calm and steadfast eye on Javan
when he heard him propose that one of his own kinsmen
should be treated with an indignity which would not
have been offered to the meanest Jewish beggar; and
he met the gaze of his cousin fixed on him with an
expression of concern and interest that only surprised
him the more.  Javan had attained the object for which
he had been labouring and intriguing so long; and now
that Theophilus was in his power, he almost regretted
that his principles compelled him to complete his
revenge.  He hastily desired that the prisoners might be
removed, and all placed in separate cells.  No sooner
was this order obeyed, than the fierceness of his
countenance returned; and rising from his seat he began to
denounce Isaac as a traitor to his religion and his party,
and proceeded to state all the particulars which he had
heard from Reuben of his double-dealing and his
conspiracy with Amaziah for the rescue of an accursed
apostate.  Javan spoke with violence, as if to work up
his own feelings of anger against Theophilus and all
who wished to save his life; and he succeeded in exciting
those of his colleagues.  Isaac would have denied the
charge brought against him; but Javan compelled his
informer unwillingly to appear and swear to the truth of
his statement, when he detailed so minutely the
conversation which he had overheard between Amaziah and
the President, and also the orders which he had himself
received from Isaac to procure the services of some men
on whom he could depend, and conduct them to Amaziah
on the appointed morning, that no doubt remained
of his guilt.  He saw that his reputation and influence
were gone, and after a sharp altercation with Javan, he
left his seat and hurried from the hall.  A short time he
was shut up in a private room in his own house, while
his servants guarded the door, and then he delivered a
letter to his most confidential attendant, and gave orders
for the removal of all his valuable goods to a place of
security which he pointed out.  This done, he armed
himself completely, and, followed by such of his domestics
as had consented to accompany him, he left the house,
and pursued the most obscure and unfrequented paths
that led to the temple.  In this holy edifice the Zealots
and Idumeans were still established and fortified, and
at the outer gate he presented himself, and demanded to
speak with John of Gischala, the valiant leader of the
party.
</p>

<p>
He was speedily admitted to the presence of the wily
John, but his attendants were detained in an outer
court until the will of the chief should be made known.
Isaac's story was listened to with great satisfaction by
John; and his offers of alliance were gladly received,
for he was known to be a man of power and abilities, and
his desertion of the popular party, as it was then called,
was an event of considerable importance.  The bitterness
with which he spoke of his former friends was a
guarantee to John that an impassable gulf had now
separated them, and his quick discernment enabled him
to discover and profit by the irritated feelings of his new
ally.  He had brought with him all the portable wealth
which he possessed, and which was very considerable;
so that in all respects he was a most welcome ally.
</p>

<p>
His desertion to the opposing party was soon known
to Javan and his colleagues, and they immediately
pronounced him a traitor, and confiscated his house and
property to the use of the state&mdash;as they styled their
own self-constituted authority&mdash;but they found little of
value remaining in the building.  The servants had
removed everything that they could carry, not to place
it in security for their master, but to appropriate to their
own use; and the house was left desolate and empty.
The letter which Isaac had entrusted to his favourite
domestic was faithfully delivered to Mary, his affianced
bride, but it failed to produce the effect which he had
designed.  It contained a vehement entreaty that she
would follow him to the temple, and in that sacred place
unite herself to him for ever.  He urged that his love
for her, and desire to comply with her wishes, had been
the sole cause of his present distress; but that if she
would keep her plighted faith and join him with all her
riches, he doubted not they could find means to escape
together from Jerusalem, and enjoy wealth and happiness
in some more favoured clime.
</p>

<p>
Mary of Bethezob had agreed to unite herself to Isaac
when he was in power and a high station, but she had
no regard for him that was strong enough to tempt her
to take such a step as he proposed.  She replied to his
letter with a decided rejection of all his plans, and a
declaration that she should adhere to her resolution of
seeing him no more, since he had failed to procure the
liberty of Theophilus.  Her letter was delivered to his
servant, who immediately followed his master to the
temple, and attached himself to the party which he had
espoused.  Javan's indignation at the conduct of Isaac
was very great: he had placed considerable confidence
in him; and had revealed to him many particulars of his
secret intercourse with Simon, and his intentions of
inviting him into the city as soon as he could sufficiently
prepare the way for his reception by the popular party.
All these designs he knew would now be disclosed to his
bitter enemy, John of Gischala, who might, by his
craft or his power, be enabled to frustrate them; and he
resolved to hasten their execution as much as possible,
that he might bring Simon and his forces within the
walls of the city before the wily and intriguing John
could have time to concert any plans of opposition.  But
he wished that Amaziah should depart from Jerusalem
before the son of Gioras was raised to the sovereign
command.  His bigotry and his revenge were sated by
the capture and condemnation of Theophilus; and the
conduct of his cousin had convinced him that threats
and sufferings were ineffectual to make the Nazarenes
forsake their opinions.  He did not therefore wish to
apprehend his uncle, and have to witness the same
exhibition of fortitude and faith which had excited his
admiration in Theophilus, and the same grief and horror
which his exertions for the honour of Judaism had
already caused to his parents and relatives.  What a
strange mixture of good and evil was Javan! and how
entirely did his narrow and prejudiced views of religion
mar his own happiness, and extinguish all the better
feelings and more noble propensities of his heart!
</p>

<p>
Zadok and his unhappy brother had returned to their
home, after the fruitless effort for the preservation of the
prisoner.  A crowd of persons were assembled round
the door of the prison, and the cause of the disturbance
which was heard within the walls soon reached them,
and excited a great feeling of indignation against
Amaziah.  The Nazarenes were held in entire abhorrence by
the populace; and the rumour that an attempt had been
made to rescue a convicted heretic and others, to deprive
them of the savage joy with which they always hailed
the execution of such victims, filled them with rage.
But when they beheld Amaziah come forth from the
porch leaning on the arm of the holy and respected
Zadok, the tide of feeling was divided.  Some of those
who knew and esteemed the character of the afflicted
father, were touched by his profound but manly grief;
while others loudly assailed him with insulting epithets,
as the father of an apostate, and even as being suspected
of sharing the guilt of his son.  The presence and
protection of Zadok, and the commanding manner in which
by his voice and gestures he forbade the approach of the
angry multitude, were hardly sufficient to prevent their
rushing on Amaziah, and inflicting summary vengeance
on this unoffending and almost broken-hearted man
But those who pitied his sorrow united with his own
attendants and followers, and formed a strong guard
around the noble brothers, and in this manner conducted
them safely to their own dwelling, amidst the cries and
insults and curses of the infuriated mob.
</p>

<p>
The anxious inmates of Zadok's house, who sat trembling
and weeping while expecting the return of their
relatives from the trial, were startled by the shouts of the
approaching multitude; and for a moment their hopes
were excited that these might be cries of joy and
triumph, to announce the acquittal of the prisoner.  But
as the crowd came nearer, they heard the curses and
blasphemies that were uttered in a loud and threatening
tone; and while they felt that no hope remained of
Theophilus being free, they also feared for the safety of
those who were equally dear to them.  They hastened
to the housetop, from whence they could look down on
the street below, and they were terrified at the tumult
they beheld, and at the danger which seemed to menace
both Amaziah and Zadok; for the priest himself had
become an object of temporary wrath, from his connexion
with the denounced and hated Nazarenes, and
his determined efforts to protect his brother.
</p>

<p>
Salome and her companions watched the still increasing
crowd, until the objects of their anxiety had reached the
strong gates that gave entrance into the court of the
house; and when they were assured that they had
passed through, and were safe from the assaults of their
pursuers, they descended to meet them in the vestibule,
and to hear all their apprehensions most fatally
confirmed with regard to their beloved Theophilus.  They
had persuaded themselves that they were prepared for
this result; but yet the shock was so severe, that it
proved how much more of hope had lingered in every
breast than had been acknowledged to each other, or
even to themselves.  Claudia was entirely unable to
command herself, and she retired with Naomi to indulge
her grief, and listen to the consolations which her pious
and highly-gifted friend was enabled to bestow.  When
they had left the apartment, Zadok endeavoured to
change the sad current of his own thoughts and those of
his family, by urging on Amaziah the necessity for his
immediately quitting the city.  He represented to him
the extreme danger to which he exposed himself, and
those who were dearest to him, by remaining any longer
in a place where he had become the object of so much
resentment, both among the higher and lower classes;
and as his further stay could now be of no advantage to
his unhappy son, he earnestly entreated him to commence
his journey on the following morning, and thus escape
from impending destruction, and remove himself and his
family to a distance from the cruel scene which would
take place at noon on that day.  The feelings of
Amaziah were harrowed by this appeal; and yet consideration
for his family would have induced him to comply
with his brother's advice, however painful it would be to
him to leave the city while his son was yet alive, to suffer
shame and death; but Judith would not listen to the
proposal.
</p>

<p>
"No," she exclaimed, "nothing shall tear me hence
until I know that my child is dead.  If danger is to be
encountered, I will not flee from it, till he is set free for
ever from all pain and all peril.  Then, when his ransomed
and purified spirit is in the mansions of peace and
joy, I will go forth with my husband, and seek a shelter
in some spot where virtue and piety are not the mark
for insult and murder."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Judith," replied Zadok, "I feel for your sorrow;
and I would to God that I could have power to remove
it.  Your errors and those of my brother have not
destroyed my love for you, deeply as I deplore them;
and anxiety for your safety is my only motive for urging
you to leave my house.  While you remain, which must
be as short a time as possible, I will protect you even
with my own life; and when you consent to seek a safer
refuge, I will go with you and guard you on your way
as far as Joppa.  Though we have now, alas! no longer
the same object in attending you there which first
induced me to consent to take the journey, yet I feel
that I can be a protection to you; and also that our poor
afflicted Claudia will be soothed and supported by Naomi's
presence."
</p>

<p>
"You have never been unkind, Zadok, even when
most displeased with us," said Judith; "and this is a
proof of your affection which I gratefully accept.  Your
society and that of our dear Naomi will be the greatest
consolation that we can enjoy during our melancholy
journey.  I will make the best return that is in my
power for your kindness, by remaining beneath your roof
no longer than until the sun has set to-morrow.
Oh! how that word to-morrow makes my heart sink away
and fail within me!  But I will be strong in the help of
the Lord, and try to conquer such faithless fear and
dread.  I will promise to be ready to leave this most
melancholy and yet most beloved place when to-morrow's
light is fading away, and we may then reach Joppa the
following evening.  I will go now and give orders to
our servants, that everything may be prepared, for I may
not be so well able to exert myself to-morrow.  Come,
dear sister Salome, and give me your aid and your kind
sympathy."
</p>

<p>
The necessity for exertion was useful to Judith and to
Salome, who called up unwonted firmness, and commanded
her feelings, that she might be able to assist
those whose sorrow was so much deeper than her own.
When Claudia was informed of the determination to
leave Jerusalem on the morrow, she seemed to be
overwhelmed with fresh grief, and earnestly besought that
she might not be torn away so soon, and even that she
might remain altogether with Naomi, and enjoy the
melancholy pleasure of recalling all her past happiness,
and dwelling in the same place where she had conversed
with him, and learned from his lips the way of everlasting
life.  Kindly and gently Naomi reasoned with her,
and showed her the danger and impropriety of her
wish being gratified.  She spoke of Judith's solitude
when deprived of her son, and also of her whom she
already looked upon as a daughter, and that argument
made its way to Claudia's affectionate heart, and changed
her inclinations.  She resolved to follow her adopted
mother wherever she and Amaziah should go, and to
devote herself to the task of cheering them, and
supplying the place of their only child: and this resolution
roused and supported her, and gave her an object for
which she felt content to live and to bear her sorrow, so
long as the Lord should appoint her days on earth.
</p>

<p>
The hours passed away, though slowly and sadly.
Even Mary of Bethezob, whose spirits were usually
unfailing, was buried in silence and sorrow: and little
David, the life and amusement of all the house in
happier days, was unnoticed and neglected.  Night
brought no cessation of the misery of that family, for
sleep did not visit them, and they met on the fatal
morning with countenances that showed deep traces of
watchfulness and tears.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
</h3>

<p>
The sun approached his meridian height, and as he
mounted higher and higher the feelings of the sad and
watching group became more intensely excited, until at
the sixth hour, when his burning rays fell vertically on
the terrace into which the apartment opened, a distant
noise of the voices of many people reached their ears.
It was a savage shout of joy and exultation; and it
sunk into the hearts of the mourners as a death-knell.
At that moment the headless bodies of the nine victims
were thrown over the prison walls, and suspended there
to be the objects of insult and mockery to the barbarous
multitude.  Javan's order that the executions should
take place in the cells of the prison, and not publicly,
had occasioned great discontent among the populace, who
had expected to indulge their cruel and bloodthirsty
inclinations by witnessing the last sufferings of the
Nazarenes; and to gratify them the bodies were thus exposed
until sunset; while wine and food were liberally
distributed among the crowd at the command of Javan and
his colleagues, who feared to excite the displeasure
of the lawless rabble at such a time of sedition and
insubordination.
</p>

<p>
A servant of Zadok's had been privately sent by him
to await the exhibition of the dreadful spectacle, and to
bring the intelligence to him when all was over.  The
man had known Theophilus well, and had loved him;
and when he returned to his master's house, and Zadok
met him in the vestibule, he was trembling with horror
and distress.  The heads of the unhappy victims had
not been exposed, but he had recognised the body of
Theophilus by the garments which he well-remembered,
and particularly a vest which Claudia had embroidered,
and which he had worn on the evening when he left the
house to return no more.  Zadok rejoined his family,
and they saw too plainly by his agitated countenance
that all was over.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,
and blessed be the name of the Lord!" said he solemnly,
as he entered the room; and a burst of uncontrollable
grief was the only reply.  But Amaziah did not long
give way to this natural emotion; he knelt down in the
midst of the group, who all followed his example; and
in a tone of calmness, that astonished Zadok and Salome,
he offered up fervent praises and thanksgivings that his
dear son had now fought the good fight and finished his
course, and had received the crown of glory laid up for
him in heaven.
</p>

<p>
This done, he called his brother aside, and spoke to
him on the subject that now weighed heaviest on his
heart.  The suggestion of Javan that the bodies of the
prisoners should be burnt in the fires of Hinnom had
been made known to him, and had occasioned additional
misery both to him and Judith; and he requested Zadok
to use all his influence with Javan and the other
members of the council to obtain an order for the body of
Theophilus to be restored to them, that they might have
the satisfaction of burying it before they left the city.
Zadok feared that his efforts to procure this indulgence
would not be successful, but he readily promised to make
the attempt; and immediately left the house in search
of his son, who had not appeared to his family since the
fatal sentence had been pronounced on the preceding
day.  He found him at the house of one of his
colleagues; and the air of satisfaction that reigned on
his countenance gave a bitter pang to the heart of his
father.
</p>

<p>
"Javan," he said, in a tone which showed his own
emotions, "the dreadful scene is over, and I can no
longer plead for the life of our kinsman.  He has paid
the debt which perhaps was due to his offended country
and violated religion; and I would to God that he
were yet living to forsake his errors and redeem his
character.  It is passed&mdash;and henceforth never let us
speak on this subject again.  My object in now coming
to you is to request, as a favour to myself, that the body
of one who is so nearly connected to me may not be
exposed to the indignity which forms part of the
sentence pronounced upon him.  You were the proposer of
that additional cruelty, and doubtless you can obtain the
reversion of the sentence, if not for all the criminals, yet
at least in this single instance."
</p>

<p>
"My father," replied Javan, "I see that you also
wrong me, and attribute to me a wanton cruelty that is
not in my nature.  I did not wish my cousin's death;
it was his restoration to virtue and piety that I desired;
and that being hopeless, no course remained but to
allow the laws of our holy religion to be executed.  I
have but discharged my duty in removing the unclean
thing from the camp of Israel, and sparing not my own
flesh and blood when the honour of Jehovah required
the sacrifice.  I had expected that you, my revered
father, would have applauded my zeal, and joined with
me in purging out this dreadful heresy, whatever might
be the cost.  But since you blame me, I must stand
alone, and my conscience bears me witness that I stand
guiltless.  As to your request for the body of my
misguided cousin, it grieves me to deny it; but I have no
power to change the sentence.  It was passed by the
assembled council, as a preventive to sacrilege and
profaneness; and I cannot from personal
considerations, demand the reversion of so wise and necessary
a decree."
</p>

<p>
Zadok's brow grew dark.  He had condescended to
ask a favour from his son, instead of laying on him a
command, which would have been more in accordance
with Jewish manners, but which in Javan's case had
long been found ineffectual.  He had thrown off the
paternal yoke whenever the obedience which was
required was in opposition to his own views and
principles; and though he respected and loved his father,
he considered himself much more competent than
Zadok to judge what line of conduct it was right to
adopt.  He saw that his father was frequently influenced
by his kind and generous feelings to depart from the
severe principles of his sect, and to lay aside the narrow
views which generally governed the proud Pharisees of
that period; while he prided himself on making every
feeling and every interest give way to party spirit and
religious bigotry.  He had therefore learnt to treat his
excellent and high-minded father as an equal, instead of
looking up to him as the guide and example which in
his earlier years it was his highest aim to follow and
imitate.  Zadok knew and felt all this, and he perceived
that his son was now acting from motives which he did
not entirely disclose, and which probably he thought his
father would neither share nor duly estimate.  He was
convinced that Javan was not to be shaken by persuasion,
and he spared himself the pain of a second refusal;
but for Claudia's sake he made another request, which
he felt sure could not be denied.  He desired that Javan
would send for the vest in which the corpse of Theophilus
was still attired, and allow him to carry it back to
his unhappy young friend, as a last relic of him whom
she had loved so fervently.  To this Javan readily
consented, and requested his father to tarry in the house of
his friend until he should return with the embroidered
garment, as he imagined that he would not willingly go
to gaze on the mangled remains of his beloved nephew.
He was not long absent, and when he returned he placed
in Zadok's hand the vest, which was stained with the
blood of the noble victim.  The priest looked at it with
deep emotion, and then returned to his own now gloomy
dwelling.
</p>

<p>
Claudia had not been informed of the degradation
which was designed for the remains of the heroic band
of prisoners, and therefore she knew nothing of the
object for which Zadok had gone forth.  But when he
gave her the well-remembered vest which she had
worked with so much delight, and which Theophilus
had loved so much to wear, she thanked him with her
tears for his kind consideration in procuring it for her,
and pressed the sad relic to her heart, with a feeling that
all her earthly hopes had flown away with the life-blood
that stained it.
</p>

<p>
Javan did not come home that day.  He knew from
Reuben of everything that was going on in his father's
house; but to the surprise of that artful and cold-blooded
villain, he took no steps to prevent the departure of his
uncle, and secure another victim to tyranny and
fanaticism.  Reuben marvelled at his employer's apathy;
and had not Javan read his countenance, and suspected
designs, he would have hurried away and betrayed
Amaziah's movements to others of the council, who
would not have scrupled to take advantage of such
information, and perhaps to waylay and apprehend him.
His destruction and that of his family had long been
determined on by these men, who were so zealous for
the law; and they hoped to execute their purpose at an
early opportunity, never suspecting that Amaziah would
leave the city so immediately after the catastrophe
which had befallen him.  Javan was, of course, not
ignorant of these intentions; and he secretly rejoiced
that they would be frustrated.  Indeed it was owing to
his contrivances that the warnings had been given to
his uncle to lose no time; and he had said enough in
his father's hearing to make him urge the instant
departure of his relatives; and to prevent the possibility
of Reuben's busy and intriguing spirit being exerted
to thwart his private wishes for his uncle's escape,
he kept him in his sight the whole of the day, and
did not suffer him to speak to any person out of his
hearing.
</p>

<p>
Thus, though Amaziah and his family knew it not,
the same Javan who had caused all their anguish and
woe was now engaged in securing their safety; and it
was owing to his precautions, that when the last rays of
the sun were gleaming on the summit of Mount Olivet,
they passed quietly and undisturbed through the
water-gate, and entered the valley of Jehosaphat, that ran
along the eastern wall of the city, watered by the brook
of Kedron, and filled with blooming gardens and fruitful
orchards.  This was not the way by which the travellers
would naturally have quitted Jerusalem to proceed
towards Joppa, as that city lay to the north-west; but
they were unwilling to traverse the streets in order to
reach the gate of the Upper Fountain, for they feared to
expose themselves to observation.  Therefore they passed
along the valley until they came to the Tower of the
Corner, when they took the road to Rama and Emmaus.
They were a sad and silent party, and all were deeply
absorbed in their own melancholy reflections.  Even the
servants and armed attendants felt so much respect and
sympathy for their sorrow, that they spoke not, save in a
whisper; and no sound was heard to break the stillness
of the evening, except the measured tread of the mules
that carried the litters and the baggage, and the horses
on which Zadok and Amaziah rode.  Naomi and Claudia
travelled in the same conveyance; but Judith preferred
being alone, that she might lift up her soul to God in
freedom, and pour her griefs into the compassionate
bosom of her Redeemer.  It had been a severe trial to
her, as well as to her husband and Claudia, to leave the
place where all that remained of their beloved Theophilus
yet rested; and when she found herself enclosed in the
curtains of the litter, and hidden from every eye but that
of her Heavenly Father, she gave a vent to her sorrow,
which relieved her bursting heart.  Salome had offered
to accompany her to Joppa, with Zadok and Naomi,
but Judith would not allow her to do so.  Her health
was delicate, and the late trying scenes had so powerfully
affected her, that she was not equal to the journey,
and she therefore remained at home with Mary and her
lovely little boy, who were to abide in her house until
the return of Zadok and her daughter.  Javan too would
be her protector and occasional companion, though his
presence had ceased to give his mother the pleasure
that once it did, since he had been the means of
changing her happy home into a scene of anxious care and
sorrow.
</p>

<p>
While Amaziah and his company were passing forth
from Zadok's house, and descending the steep street that
led to the water-gate, they heard the distant sound of
rumbling wheels on the bridge that crossed the brook of
Siloam above the pool, and led to the road that opened
into the valley of Hinnom.  Zadok and Amaziah turned
a quick and anxious gaze behind them, and saw afar off
two heavy carts, attended by armed guards, and
followed by a vast concourse of persons.  The distance
and the fading light prevented their distinguishing
what burden the vehicles bore, but they knew that
they contained the relics of the good, the brave, and the
dearly-loved, and they shuddered as they thought of
their destination.
</p>

<p>
The valley of Hinnom lay to the south of the city,
between Solomon's Pool and the Potter's Field.  A
stream ran through it, which flowed into the Kedron,
and by the side of this rapid stream the smoke of
constant fires was ever rising, and a hot and sickly vapour
filled the air and rose to the hills on which the southern
wall of Zion was built.  In the shadow of that wall
Javan was pacing to and fro, followed by Reuben, whom
he still retained near him, until he could feel certain
that his uncle was beyond the reach of his enemies.  It
would be difficult to say why Javan had chosen to resort
to that spot at such a time.  The loathsome valley was
generally shunned by all who were not compelled by
necessity to pass that way; and Javan had seldom
visited the elevated terrace that overlooked it, and which
but for this circumstance would have been a favourite
and frequented walk.  The view which this site
commanded was noble and extensive, reaching over the
varied and fertile plain to the Dead Sea and the mountains
of Arabia Petræa, which form its eastern boundary,
and embracing also the Hills of Judgment and Mount
Olivet to the left.  But it was not the beauty of this
prospect that drew Javan thither on the present
occasion.  It was rather a strange desire to see the
conclusion of a scene of horror and of woe, which had
occupied his mind and filled him with gloomy and
anxious thoughts for so many days and weeks.  He had
accomplished all his schemes against his unhappy cousin;
but he was not happy&mdash;for with all his efforts he could
not stifle his natural feelings so entirely as to be
insensible to the sorrow which he had brought upon his
family.  He dreaded returning home to encounter the
silent reproach of their tears; and almost unconsciously
he wandered towards the valley of Hinnom, to excite
still more his feelings of horror, by witnessing the last
indignity that could be offered to the remains of the
victims of fanaticism.
</p>

<p>
The heavy carts rolled slowly along the valley, and
paused as they reached each smouldering fire.  The
filth and rubbish which composed the daily fuel of these
fires were nearly exhausted: but fresh combustibles
were cast on them to make the funeral-piles of the
martyrs, and then the bodies were flung, naked and
headless, to be reduced to ashes.  Javan watched them
one by one, and by the light of the lurid flames he saw
nine livid corpses thrown from the carts.  His heart
sickened, but he could not leave the spot, and there he
stood, gazing down on the dreadful spectacle until all
was over.  The forms of the degraded criminals whose
loathsome office it was to attend to these fires, were seen
moving about amid the smoke and vapour, and appeared
fitting inhabitants of this Gehenna, or place of Hell-fire,
as it was commonly called.  To Javan's excited imagination
the altars once erected on this spot to Chemosh,
Moloch, and Ashtaroth, were present again, reeking with
their human sacrifices; and the cries of the innocent
children who were offered up by hundreds to the gods
of cruelty and murder sounded in his ears.  The savage
mob that had followed the dead-carts stood round to
enjoy the spectacle, and as the flames burst forth afresh,
and the bodies consumed away, they expressed their
exultation and joy by loud discordant shouts, that only
added to the infernal character of the scene.  Among
this rabble were some who came from other motives,
and who trembled with stifled emotion, while to escape
observation they endeavoured to join in the cries of the
surrounding crowd.  These were the friends and relatives
of the martyred Nazarenes, and they came to wait
until vengeance had been satiated on the bodies of those
they loved, and the valley should be abandoned to the
dogs and the vultures that lurked around to snatch their
horrid meal.
</p>

<p>
One by one the fires went out, and darkness overspread
the valley.  The crowd dispersed, and the criminals
left their daily employment to seek a short repose in
some wretched huts at a little distance from the place of
their appointed labours.  Then, when all was silent, Javan
saw a number of men and women approach one of the
fires which yet continued smouldering, and light their
torches at the embers.  Carefully they searched among
the ashes for the bones of their relatives which yet were
unconsumed, and having collected them from every fire,
they enclosed the precious relics altogether in a casket,
and noiselessly moved away down the valley toward
Solomon's Pool.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I follow them?" whispered Reuben; and
Javan started at the sound of his harsh voice, for he
had forgotten that the menial was still waiting near
him, and watching all that occurred in the valley with
an interest equal to his own, but of a different nature.
"Shall I follow them?" he repeated, "for they must
surely be some of those accursed Nazarenes, who thus
came to seek the remains of the malefactors.  They
cannot enter the city to-night, and I can watch where
they hide.  And then if your guards are let out on
them in their lurking-place, we shall easily secure the
prey, and ere long we shall have another such day
as this!"
</p>

<p>
"Silence, villain!" cried Javan, disgusted at the
coarse brutality of the menial, who believed that his
employer shared his own feelings of gratification in
the actual cruelties of that day, and thought that, like
him, he would rejoice in the prospect of a repetition
of them.
</p>

<p>
"Follow me to the city," he continued, "and you
shall receive to-morrow the reward of your services.
When I require them again I shall summon you; and
meanwhile I command you to exert your powers of
observation, and inform me if anything occurs which
way be of consequence to my affairs; but see that you
confide in no one else at your peril.  Especially keep
watch whether Isaac or any of his emissaries attempt
to hold intercourse with your noble mistress, for we must
preserve her and her property from his hands."
</p>

<p>
Reuben obeyed, and followed Javan, wondering at
his apathy in neglecting so good an opportunity of
replenishing the prison with fresh Nazarene captives,
and regretting the reward which he might have received
for his information from others of the Pharisees or
chief-priests.  But he did not dare to dispute Javan's
commands, and accompanied him to the gate, where they
were readily admitted, as the young Pharisee was well
known to the officer on guard there.  They proceeded to
the house of one of Javan's friends, and passed the night
there; and in the morning returned to the dwelling of
Zadok, where they soon learnt from Deborah that the
priest, with his brother and all his family, had left the city
on the preceding evening.  Hannah had also accompanied
them, with several others of their domestics who were
suspected of partaking in their heretical opinions; and
none remained who could be objects of persecution on
account of their faith.
</p>

<p>
This was satisfactory news to Javan, and he immediately
dismissed Reuben with a liberal present; and
having paid his mother a short visit, which was equally
painful to them both, he occupied himself in prosecuting
his political plans, and forwarding his arrangements for
the reception of Simon.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the travellers had proceeded without
interruption through Rama to Emmaus, where they paused
to rest and refresh themselves, and then resumed their
journey.  At Lydda, where they arrived at an early
hour the following day, they made inquiries, and found
that a band of Roman soldiers had come thither from
Joppa for several days preceding, and had diligently
sought for a party of travellers from Jerusalem, but
had returned each evening greatly disappointed at not
meeting them.  It was hardly safe for Amaziah's company
to advance further on their way, without a stronger
guard than his own and Zadok's armed servants.  They
were about to leave the province of Judea, and enter
that of Samaria, which was almost entirely in the hands
of the Romans; and without being under the protection
of some of the conquerors, they might be exposed to
insult and danger.  But it was uncertain whether Rufus
would send his men again to meet them; and it was
even possible that he might not wait any longer at
Joppa, but return to the Roman army at Cæsarea, under
the impression that his daughter's plans were changed,
and that she would not now join him there.  These
considerations induced Zadok and Amaziah to decide on
proceeding to Joppa without delay.  They had traversed
more than half the distance which divided the two cities,
when they saw a band of soldiers approaching towards
them, whose martial bearing and well-appointed accoutrements
declared them to belong to the invincible army
of Rome.  Whether they came as friends or foes could
not be discovered, and therefore Amaziah marshalled
his men, and prepared for resistance if necessary.
</p>

<p>
The fears of his party were however speedily removed,
by seeing the officer who commanded the troop put his
horse into a gallop and advance alone to meet them.  It
was Marcellus; and though so many years had elapsed
since Zadok and Amaziah had seen him, they immediately
recognised his noble, ingenuous expression of
countenance; and the warmth of feeling that beamed in
his bright eye when he extended his hand to greet them,
showed them that his long absence had not deadened
his affections or obliterated the remembrance of early
friendship.
</p>

<p>
His own eagerness prevented him at the first moment
from observing that his friends did not receive him with
the same joyful feelings that filled his own heart, and
he was going to hurry past them towards the litters
that followed at some distance, exclaiming,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Where is my dear sister, and where is Naomi?
Theophilus, too, I do not see him; but no doubt he is
in close attendance on Claudia.  He is a happy man!
I wish my prospects in life were as smiling as his."
</p>

<p>
Amaziah turned away in anguish at this playful
observation; and Zadok caught the hand of Marcellus, who
now perceived that all was not so full of happiness as he
supposed.
</p>

<p>
"Is anything the matter?" he cried.  "Is Naomi
safe and well?" his fears making him recur first to her
who was uppermost in his thoughts and affections.
</p>

<p>
"It is not for her, my son," replied Zadok, "that
your sympathy will be excited; our poor Claudia will
want all your affectionate consolations."
</p>

<p>
"What has befallen my own dear sister?" interrupted
Marcellus hastily, yet with a feeling of relief that his
fears for Naomi were groundless.
</p>

<p>
"All her hopes and all her happiness are blighted,"
said Zadok.  "Theophilus is no more, and Claudia's
heart is widowed."
</p>

<p>
"The Lord have pity on her!" ejaculated Marcellus
fervently.  "What disease has carried him off so quickly?
But I will go to her, poor girl!  She has yet a brother
to love and to cherish her, and to mourn with her over
what she has lost."
</p>

<p>
He dismounted, and giving his horse to a servant, he
approached the litter in which his sister and Naomi
were seated.  The curtains were partially withdrawn,
and they had seen him conversing with Zadok, and knew
that the sorrowful truth was now made known to him.
Claudia sprang from the litter, and threw herself wildly
into his arms, while tears of bitter grief prevented her
utterance.  It is needless to dwell on such a meeting.
All that was kind and affectionate Marcellus expressed;
and then he gently replaced his sister in the litter, and
in a voice faltering with emotion of various kinds,
addressed himself to Naomi.  She tried to hide her
feelings of deep interest, and to meet him with the easy
freedom of an old friend; but she was not very successful,
and Marcellus saw with secret delight the embarrassment
of her manner, and the deep flush that rose on
her pale cheek.  He did not however forget the affliction
of his friends in his own happy feelings.  He hastened
to Judith's litter, and greeted her with a kindness that
only reminded her more forcibly of the son she had lost,
and who had been a friend and companion to Marcellus
when she remembered him in former happy days.
</p>

<p>
During the rest of the journey Marcellus rode by the
side of his sister, and tried to cheer her with such pious
suggestions as he believed she could receive and understand;
but he did not utter the name of the Redeemer&mdash;of
him who has promised rest to the weary and the heavy-laden,
and is especially the consolation and support of
His people under all their trials and all their sorrows.
Both Claudia and Naomi felt how ineffectual must be
every consolation that is not derived from Him, and
more than ever they regretted that Marcellus should
still, as they supposed, be ignorant of His mercies and
His power; while both resolved to lose no opportunity
of endeavouring to give him that knowledge which they
found so precious to their own souls.  But this was not
the time for entering on such discussions; and they
reached Joppa under the mutual impression that both
parties were yet in ignorance of the only true way to
peace, and to eternal life.
</p>

<p>
Rufus received the whole party with kindness and
cordiality.  His feelings were not so acute as those of
his son, but he entered into the affliction of his daughter
as much as he considered that the loss of a Jewish lover
could demand; and endeavoured to console her with the
hope of finding a more suitable husband among her own
countrymen.  This was not an effectual source of comfort
to poor Claudia; and as it also implied that her father
expected she should now return with him to the camp,
who entreated Judith, when she was alone with her and
Naomi, to request that she might still be permitted to
remain with her; and though she could now no longer
hope to become her daughter indeed, yet that she might
act a daughter's part, and dwell with her, at least until
her father had a home to take her to.  Judith would
have been deeply grieved if Claudia had been taken from
her, and she hastened to make her request known to
Rufus, who kindly consented that she should accompany
her friends to Ephesus, and remain there until he was
able to return in peace to Rome.  He was delighted
with the improvement which had taken place in her
since he had last seen her, and with the sweetness and
gentleness that was apparent in her manner, in the midst
of her deep affliction.  She exerted herself to please
her father, and to show the pleasure which she felt at
seeing him, by repressing her own grief as much as
possible in his presence.  But when she found herself
alone with Marcellus and Naomi, she indulged the
feelings of her heart by expatiating on the many virtues
and amiable qualities of him who occupied all her
thoughts; and then it was that her brother first learned
the cause of Theophilus's death.
</p>

<p>
"O Marcellus," said his sister, "how you would have
esteemed and loved him if the Lord had spared him to
meet you as a brother!  But you could not have valued
him as he deserved, for that very constancy and faith
which led him to brave death, would have appeared
madness and folly in your eyes."
</p>

<p>
"What can you mean, Claudia?" exclaimed Marcellus,
eagerly.  "Did not Theophilus die a natural death?  I
have heard no particulars, for I have been unable to
speak to Zadok in private."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have not heard that he perished a martyr
to the name of Jesus of Nazareth! and you do not know
that your unhappy sister had learned the way of salvation
from him, and now finds all her consolation and all her
hope in that faith, which you, alas! despise."
</p>

<p>
"My dearest sister," cried Marcellus, embracing her
with the warmest expressions of joy and affection, "this
is a discovery which I had not even hoped for.  Then
we are united by a tie even stronger and more sacred
than that of our own near relationship.  I too may glory
in the name of Christian; and doubly do I now regret
the untimely end of our poor Theophilus, since a union
with him would only have strengthened you in this
most holy faith, and not have tended, as I feared, to close
your heart against the admission of the truth."
</p>

<p>
Tears of surprise and delight sprang to Naomi's eyes
at this unexpected confession on the part of Marcellus;
and when he turned a look of anxious inquiry towards
her, and read the expression of her lovely and animated
countenance, he could not doubt that all for which he
had hoped and prayed was already fulfilled, and that the
great obstacle which he feared might for ever have
separated them, was already removed.
</p>

<p>
"Naomi," he said, "am I right in indulging the hope
that you also share the feelings and the sentiments of
my sister?  It would be happiness indeed to hear your
lips confess the name of Jesus the Messiah."
</p>

<p>
"Blessed be that name for ever!" replied Naomi with
fervour.  "I know that there is none other name under
heaven whereby we may be saved."
</p>

<p>
"How merciful has the Lord been to us," said Claudia,
"in thus leading us by various methods into the same
way of salvation!  When, my brother, did you hear
of Jesus? and who opened to you the treasures of the
Gospel?"
</p>

<p>
Marcellus related to his attentive auditors all the
particulars of his conversion at Rome, and the various
events which had since that time strengthened and
confirmed his faith.  And from Claudia and Naomi he
learned the interesting story of their spiritual birth and
admission into the church of Christ.  Naomi did not
dwell on what she had suffered, or the trials to which
her faith had once been subjected; but Claudia was
eloquent in describing the piety and the firmness of her
friend, and the benefit which she herself had derived
from her consistent character and holy life and conversation.
All this was music to the ears of Marcellus.  He
had loved Naomi when he was a mere boy, and as he
grew to manhood he loved her more and more.  And
after he had left Jerusalem, and entered into the gaieties
and business of life, he still looked back with fond
remembrance to the time when she was his constant companion;
and her image was ever present to his heart and his
memory.  Never during his residence at Rome, or his
subsequent wanderings, had he seen a being who could
compare with the Jewish maiden, and all his hopes of
future happiness were connected with her.  Many were
the fruitless schemes which he had at various times
devised for getting admission into Jerusalem and seeing
her again, and when he found that he was to have the
happiness of meeting her at Joppa, his anxiety and
impatience knew no bounds.  But still there was one
ever-recurring thought that damped his hopes and checked
his desire of seeing her.  He believed that Naomi was
a Jewess in religion as well as by birth.  She was the
daughter of Zadok, the zealous Pharisee, the sister of
the fanatical Javan; and could he ever hope that she
would return the affection of a Gentile, and still worse,
of a Nazarene? and even if she should yet remember
him with the same feelings that she entertained for him
in former days, was it probable that her father would
consent to bestow her on a Roman soldier; or would
his own conscience allow him to seek a union with one
who could not share his most sacred feelings, and who
would despise what he held most dear and holy?  All
these reflections rose strongly to his mind when he did
again behold her, and almost made him regret that she
appeared yet more lovely and more interesting than his
memory had depicted her.  But now to find that all his
worst fears were unfounded, and that Naomi was like
himself, a Christian, was greater happiness than he had
ever dared to hope.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before Marcellus had ascertained that
his affection for Naomi was returned, and that during
his long absence he had been remembered with all the
constancy that he could have wished; and he readily
obtained a promise that if Zadok's concurrence could be
obtained she would consent to be united to him as soon
as the war had terminated.  Until that period they
must be again separated, for Naomi would not hear of
leaving her mother under the present circumstances;
and indeed she greatly feared that a more insurmountable
obstacle would be presented in the opposition of
Zadok to their wishes.  Marcellus sought an interview
with the priest immediately after his conversation with
Naomi, and frankly declared to him his attachment to
his daughter, and his happiness in knowing that she was
not insensible to his love and constancy; and then he
requested that all his long-cherished hopes might be
crowned by a promise that she should be united to him
in marriage as soon as the state of the country would
permit him to enter Jerusalem and claim her.  Zadok
listened to his young and ardent friend with calmness,
though with a clouded brow.  Once he would have
spurned his offers with disdain, and have declared that
he would rather consign his child to the grave than
bestow her on a Gentile and a Roman; but since her
renunciation of her early faith, all his high hopes for her
future destiny had faded away.  He knew that she would
never consent to become the wife of a Jew; and if he
were to seek a partner and protector for her out of the
pale of that religion which he regarded as the only way
to heaven, where could he find one to whom he could
confide her with more satisfaction than to Marcellus?
All his ancient prejudices rose up to oppose the plan
but esteem for the private character of the suppliant,
and consideration for Naomi's own wishes on the subject
prevailed.  He consented, though unwillingly, that
if at any future time Marcellus should come to demand
his daughter, and be enabled to offer her a happy and
peaceful home, he should be rewarded for his constancy
by receiving her hand, and the rich dowry which was
always intended to be her marriage portion.
</p>

<p>
Joyfully did Marcellus hasten to communicate this
unhoped-for acquiescence to Naomi; and but for the
sorrow that weighed so heavily on the heart of Claudia
and her friends, and cast a gloom over all their own
happiness, the few days that they passed together at
Joppa would have been the brightest of their lives.
</p>

<p>
Judith and Amaziah rejoiced sincerely at the prospect
of Naomi's being removed from Jerusalem, and thenceforth
permitted to exercise her religion without opposition;
and Claudia tried to offer her congratulations; but
tears prevented her words of joy from being audible, for
her heart recurred with a feeling of desolation to the
time so lately past, when all the happiness that now
seemed to be presented to Naomi had been so suddenly
snatched from her own grasp, and buried for ever in the
grave of Theophilus.
</p>

<p>
Nearly a week had elapsed since the arrival of the
travellers, and the vessel that was to sail from Joppa to
Ephesus had received her cargo, when a notice was
given to Amaziah that she would weigh anchor the
following morning, and that he and his party must go on
board at sunrise.  All his baggage was taken to the ship
that same evening; and at the dawn of day Naomi took
leave of the friends she loved so well, and stood on the
shore to watch with weeping eyes the boat that carried
them out to the vessel.  It was a sorrowful parting for
them all; but Naomi had not time for a long indulgence
of her grief, as Zadok announced to her that it would
be necessary for him to leave Joppa that same day, and
that she must be in readiness to start in a few hours.
Letters had just reached him from Javan, to desire his
speedy return to the city, as important political
arrangements demanded his presence, and therefore, as their
friends had departed, there was nothing to detain them
any longer from home.
</p>

<p>
Marcellus and Naomi thought differently, but they did
not venture to plead for a further delay; and in the
afternoon they left Joppa with Zadok and Rufus, who
accompanied his friends as far as Lydda.  From thence
the priest and his daughter proceeded towards Jerusalem,
and Rufus and his son turned their steps in the
opposite direction, to join their comrades at Cæsarea.
Then did the rough but kind-hearted soldier give vent
to all his feelings of indignation at the conduct of Javan,
which he had hitherto restrained out of respect for Zadok.
He vowed vengeance against the treacherous Jew, who
had thus escaped from the Roman army to blast the
happiness of his own family, and reduce Claudia to sorrow
and desolation.  Marcellus sought to check his rage;
but he could not wonder that an idolater should thus feel
towards one who professed to be guided by a pure religion,
and yet disgraced his profession by cruelty and
treachery, such as the heathen would have scorned to
commit.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
</h3>

<p>
Zadok and Naomi were shocked, on their return home,
to see how greatly the recent melancholy events had left
their traces on the appearance of Salome.  For some
time past her health and strength had declined, and it
was evident that the anxiety she had suffered from so
many causes, and the shock which her feelings had
undergone at the lamentable termination, had been too
much for her delicate constitution to sustain uninjured.
Her spirits were broken, and Naomi frequently excited
all her powers in vain to animate and interest her.  Her
mind was filled with gloomy forebodings of coming woe;
and though the sweetness of her manner was undiminished,
and her affectionate kindness unabated, yet
there was ever a pensive sadness in her look and voice,
that sank into Naomi's heart with a painful emotion of
dread.
</p>

<p>
Mary of Bethezob repaired to her own dwelling soon
after the return of Zadok, and her blooming and intelligent
boy accompanied her; but he had become so much
attached to Salome and Naomi, that great part of his
time was passed with them, and by his innocent playfulness,
he greatly helped to chase away their sorrows,
while his thoughtless and light-hearted mother plunged
again into gaiety and dissipation, and soon forgot all that
had so deeply interested her while she was under Zadok's
roof.
</p>

<p>
The priest himself was at this time much from home,
for his counsel was sought by those who were most active
in the affairs of the city; and as he had lately become a
warm supporter of Javan's scheme for bringing Simon
to take the supreme command, his son gladly availed
himself of his influence and his eloquence in persuading
others to join their party.  All the necessary arrangements
were soon completed; and Javan departed on his
mission to invite the son of Gioras and his troops to
enter the walls, and rid the oppressed inhabitants of
every tyranny but their own.  Not many days after he
had left the city, alarming news reached the chiefs and
leaders: Vespasian had once more set his troops in
motion, and was rapidly passing through the toparchies
of Gophnitis and Acrabatane.  A few more days passed
away, during which the inhabitants of Zion looked forth
anxiously for the approach of Simon, as the only succour
that could avail them if the Roman arms should be
turned against their city; but he came not&mdash;and instead
of his friendly troops, the cavalry of Vespasian appeared
at the gates of Jerusalem.  A panic seized the populace
at this unexpected sight; but their fears were of short
duration, for the dreaded horsemen only remained a few
days in the vicinity of the city, and having ascertained
the distracted and divided state of the inhabitants,
withdrew again to head-quarters, and left the devoted place
to be yet further weakened by its domestic enemies.
</p>

<p>
The terrace at the back of Zadok's house commanded
a view of the fields beyond the walls, and in that direction
the noble equestrian band, the flower of Vespasian's
army, passed by, as they retired from the city.  They had
traversed its whole circumference, and taken observations
of its strength, and the capability of its walls and
towers.  Naomi knew that Marcellus belonged to this
troop; and it was not surprising that when she heard
the trumpets echoing along the side of Mount Olivet,
she should look anxiously from the terrace-wall, and
strain her eyes to distinguish him among the rest of the
cavaliers.  She believed that she succeeded, and perhaps
she was right, for one of that band tarried behind his
companions, and turned his head long towards the spot
where she stood; but if it were Marcellus he did not
perceive her, for he rode on without any signal of
recognition; and she returned to her mother to lament that
she should thus be divided, by all the obstacles of war,
from the being who was so well deserving of her affection.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile one of the Roman commanders named
Cerealis had passed to the south, and entering Idumea,
had taken Caphethra, Capharabis, and Hebron.  Almost
every strong place was now in the hands of the Romans,
and nothing remained for their conquering arms to
subdue but Herodium, Machærus, Masada, and Jerusalem
itself.  Simon had secured himself and his forces in
his stronghold at Masada while the enemy were reducing
Idumea; but when Cerealis withdrew from that district,
he again came forth and ravaged the already wasted
country.  He drove a vast number of the wretched
population before his pursuing army towards Jerusalem,
where they sought a refuge from his cruelty, and once
more he encamped before the walls, to wait for the
opening of the gates to admit him.
</p>

<p>
Javan had joined him at Masada, and now accompanied
him to Jerusalem, expecting that he would be
joyfully received by the inhabitants.  But the Roman
cavalry had left the vicinity; and the party who opposed
Simon's entrance had gained a temporary ascendancy,
so that the gates remained rigorously closed, and the
chieftain revenged himself for his disappointment by
putting to the sword all the unfortunate stragglers who
ventured beyond the protection of the walls.  Thus he
warred on the unhappy city without, while John of
Gischala oppressed it within.  The hardy Galileans whom
he had brought into Jerusalem with him were entirely
corrupted by the pillage and license which he permitted
to them.  Robbery had become their constant
occupation, and murders were daily committed by them in wanton
pastime.  Disguised in rich and splendid garments which
they had acquired by rapine, they paraded the streets
in parties; and suddenly drawing their swords, that were
always concealed beneath their assumed garb of festivity,
they rushed on the thoughtless populace who gazed on
them, and fiercely stabbed all who came within their
reach.  No wonder that the helpless people looked
abroad for help and succour, and that even many of the
more enlightened believed that the presence of Simon
would put a stop to these atrocities.  But John was too
powerful to permit the execution of the scheme at that
moment, and had his rapidly-increasing party remained
united together, he would probably have prevented the
entrance of his rival.
</p>

<p>
At length, however, a division arose among his
followers.  His power excited the jealousy of the
Idumeans, and they suddenly attacked the Zealots, and
drove them to seek refuge in a palace near the temple,
which was used by John as a treasure-house.  Into this
edifice they followed them, and forced them to fly to the
temple itself, while they pillaged the palace of all the
rich treasures that John had accumulated and stored up
within its walls.  But the Zealots assembled in overwhelming
force in the temple, and in their turn threatened
to attack the Idumeans, who did not so much dread
their strength in open fight, as their desperation at being
thus cooped up.  They feared that they might sally out
and set fire to the city, and so accomplish the utter
destruction both of themselves and their enemies.  Therefore
they called together a council of the chief priests to
consider what measures should be taken, and by their
advice they adopted that plan which gave the final
blow to every hope of a return to peace and tranquillity.
</p>

<p>
The historian Josephus, in relating this circumstance,
remarks that "God overruled their wills to that most
fatal measure."  And most true is it that He does thus
overrule every event, and cause all things to work
together for the accomplishment of his own most wise
purposes.  The priests unanimously advised that Simon
should be invited to enter.  All were now of one mind,
and believed that no tyranny could be worse than the
violence and license that now distracted the city and
filled its peaceable inmates with alarm and horror.
Matthias the high-priest, who from his situation rather
than his talents exercised great influence over his
brethren, supported the proposition, and even offered to
go in person and bring in the expected preserver.  He
went forth, attended by a body of the principal men;
and amid the joyful shouts of the misguided populace
the son of Gioras marched through the streets, and
established himself, without opposition, in the higher parts
of the city.
</p>

<p>
Thus he became lord of Jerusalem in the third year
of the war; and having once got an entrance into the
city, he lost no time in securing everything that could
tend to his own advantage and raise his authority higher
over every rival faction.  John and his Zealots finding
themselves imprisoned in the temple, and totally unable
to make their way out, began to fear that their lives
would be sacrificed as well as their property, the whole
of the effects which they possessed in the city having
already been seized and appropriated by Simon and his
followers.  The new tyrant hastened to make an attack
on the temple, assisted by numbers of the populace
and had he succeeded in gaining an entrance, doubtless
he would have realized the worst fears of the besieged,
and put them all to the sword.  But the Zealots had
posted themselves in the porticoes and among the battlements,
and they vigorously repulsed their enemies, killing
and wounding many of Simon's men with the spears
and darts which they hurled down from these elevated
situations with unerring hand.  To increase still more
this advantage which they enjoyed over their assailants,
they erected four lofty towers; and from these they plied
their arrows and other missiles with little danger to
themselves, and great annoyance to the foe.  They
brought powerful engines for casting stones into each
of these towers, besides the archers and slingers; and
so great was the dread with which these machines
inspired Simon's adherents, that considerable numbers of
them declined the attack.  One of these formidable
towers was placed on the north-east corner of the temple,
the second above the Xystus, the third looked down
upon the lower city, and the fourth was built above the
Pastophoria, where the priests were accustomed to sound
the silver trumpets at the commencement and termination
of each sabbath.
</p>

<p>
Affairs were in this state at Jerusalem, and Vespasian
having subdued almost every contiguous place, returned
to Cæsarea to await the result of the civil commotions in
the capital, when news was brought him that Vitellius
had assumed the imperial purple at Rome.  This
intelligence excited great indignation among Vespasian's
officers and soldiers, who assembled in large companies,
and declared that they would never submit to be governed
by the cruel and licentious Vitellius, and that they had
as much right to elect an Emperor as the troops who
were dwelling idly at Rome.  They therefore resolved
to proclaim their general as Emperor, and to support
his authority with their swords.  For some time Vespasian
declined taking on himself the heavy responsibilities
of such an exalted station, but the tribunes only
insisted the more strenuously on his complying.  The
soldiers even drew their swords and threatened to put
him to death if he refused: when, finding all his
repeated remonstrances to be vain, he yielded to their
wishes; and after his proclamation, Josephus, who had
foretold his exaltation, was set free from his bonds, and
rewarded with great honours as a distinguished prophet,
and became the friend and adviser of Vespasian.  The
Emperor's time and attention were for some months
necessarily occupied in establishing his dominion, and
gaining over the adherence of the governors of the most
important provinces of the empire, and Jerusalem was
left to her own miseries and distractions.  But at the
commencement of the ensuing year (A.D. 70) he found
himself firmly settled on the imperial throne.  Vitellius
had been defeated, and his death left the new Emperor
at leisure to think of the reduction of the rebellious and
obstinate city, which had so long bade defiance to his
power.  He did not again go in person to attempt its
subjugation, but his son Titus was placed at the head of
the army, and sent to complete the conquest of Palestine
by the reduction of the metropolis.
</p>

<p>
During this time Marcellus had been obliged to remain
at Cæsarea with his regiment, and had vainly sought
permission to venture to Jerusalem, and try to gain an
entrance, and visit his betrothed Naomi.  The strict
discipline of the Roman army forbade his running so
great a personal risk when it was not called for in the
service of the Emperor; and he passed these long
months in anxiety and hope, waiting for the renewal of
the war as the only event which could lead to the
accomplishment of his wishes.  He did not doubt that
the capital would speedily yield to the efforts of the
army, when its combined force should be collected
beneath its walls; and then he trusted that no obstacle
would remain to his marriage with Naomi.  It was
therefore with great joy that he hailed the arrival of his
friend and commander, Titus, as generalissimo of the
Roman forces, and heard the orders for an immediate
march towards the capital, as soon as the army could be
organized and prepared for the siege.
</p>

<p>
The news of Titus having assumed the command soon
reached the miserable city, and filled the greater part of
the inhabitant with dismay.  They knew his prompt
and warlike character, and the devotion which the whole
army entertained for him; and they feared that, at the
head of such a force, he would never be repulsed from
their walls by the divided and seditious troops who
now wasted their strength in useless conflicts with each
other.  No events could have occurred more favourable
to the success of the Romans than those which were
taking place at this time in Jerusalem.  The city was
now divided into three distinct factions, and the streets
ran with the blood which was shed in their fierce
and continual encounters.  Instead of endeavouring to
organize a regular and efficient defence against the
common enemy, each party was engaged in strengthening
its own position, or attacking that of its antagonists.
</p>

<p>
Eleazar, who had been the first to set himself at the
head of the Zealots, and seize on the temple as a
garrison, beheld the superiority which was assumed by John
of Gischala, with rage and jealousy.  He affected a holy
indignation at the sanguinary outrages daily committed
by his rival; and at length he succeeded in drawing
off from his party several of the most powerful and
influential of his adherents.  With these men and their
followers he openly abandoned his former associates
who remained faithful to John, and retired into the
inner court of the temple, where, on the sacred gates
facing the Holy of Holies, these savage men suspended
their arms, yet reeking with the blood of their
fellow-citizens.
</p>

<p>
In this most sacred spot, where the sounds of the holy
instruments of music were wont to be heard, the jests
and songs of the profane soldiery now echoed from the
walls, and on the steps of the altar lay the expiring
forms of men mortally wounded by their own countrymen.
A great number of animals intended for sacrifices,
and a quantity of other provisions, were found in
the stores of the temple, and seized on by Eleazar and
his band, who were therefore well supplied with
provisions; but they could not venture to sally out on the
main body of the Zealots, who so greatly exceeded
them in numbers.  The height of their position gave
them a superiority over John's party, so long as they
remained in their stronghold; but though he suffered
greatly in every attack which he made on them, yet
his rage and resentment would not suffer him to cease
from his attempts.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Simon the son of Gioras kept possession
of the whole of the upper city and great part of the
lower, and he harassed John continually from without,
increasing his efforts when he found that his party was
weakened by division.  But John had here the advantage
over Simon that Eleazar had over John, and he
succeeded in repelling his assaults with little loss.  The
ascent to the temple was very steep, and Simon's troops
found it both difficult and perilous, for the Zealots had a
large number of scorpions, catapultas, and other engines,
and with these they repulsed their assailants from below,
and checked the party who looked down on them from
above.  Frequently it happened that the missiles which
they discharged against Eleazar and his band, either
slew or wounded those unoffending and pious persons
who still continued to repair to the spot so hallowed to
their memories, in order to offer their prayers and their
sacrifices.  Not all the horrors and dangers that
surrounded them could deter many of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and even strangers from other provinces,
from making their way to the temple where their fathers
had worshipped; and passing over the marble pavement,
now slippery with gore and strewed with the carcasses
of the slain, to lay their offerings on the altar of
the God of Jacob.
</p>

<p>
These persons were freely permitted to pass to and
fro, unmolested by the garrison, who merely took the
precaution of searching them, to discover whether they
carried concealed arms; but often, while they were
engaged in fervent prayer, they sank expiring on the
pavement, either pierced by an arrow or crushed by a
heavy stone that came whizzing from the courts below.
The noble and pious Zadok was seen to take his place
undauntedly by the side of the altar, and to perform his
sacred duties with a composure and dignity that
commanded the respect even of the lawless and blaspheming
ruffians who looked on in scoffing derision at the
superstition (as they regarded it) of the worshippers.  Many
of his sacred brethren were wounded or slain, but he
remained unharmed, and daily returned in safety to his
anxious wife and daughter, to tell of greater horrors
and fiercer conflicts than had disgraced the preceding
day.
</p>

</p>

<p>
More and more deadly did the contest become.
Eleazar's band, excited by drunkenness, ventured to
sally forth against John, and when, wearied with bloodshed,
they retired again to their garrison, he in his turn
assaulted Simon.  The whole space around the temple
became a fearful spectacle of ruin and carnage; and in
these wild conflicts the public granaries, that might have
sustained the inhabitants for years, were either set on
fire or wantonly destroyed by Simon, to prevent their
falling into the hands of John.
</p>

<p>
Thus was the wretched city afflicted.  The very power
which the short-sighted people had invoked to free them
from the tyranny of John, was turned against them and
multiplied their miseries.  The old men, the women, the
helpless and the timid prayed in secret for the arrival of
the Romans.  They had dreaded this event as the worst
of evils when first they heard it threatened; but now
they were driven to desperation by their accumulated
sufferings, and earnestly desired a foreign foe, as the
only hope of deliverance from their domestic enemies.
These wishes were, however, carefully repressed, for all
the three factions were united on one point&mdash;the
persecution and destruction, of every individual whom they
even suspected of wishing success to the Roman arms.
It was sad indeed to behold the deep but silent misery
of the people; and still more dreadful was it to witness
the inhuman desperation and hardheartedness to which
constant danger and constant suffering had driven all
ranks of men.  The ties of natural affection were
extinguished, the nearest relatives were abandoned, and when
death had put an end to their woes, their bodies were
left unheeded in the streets, to be trampled on by the
troops or torn by the dogs.
</p>

<p>
Javan had entered the city with the son of Gioras,
and was constantly engaged in his service.  Simon
confided all his schemes to him, and found him a most useful
and efficient counsellor, as he was thoroughly acquainted
with all the politics that divided the opinions of the
inhabitants: and his local knowledge of the many private
streets and lanes of the city was also an advantage to his
chieftain, and enabled him to waylay and surprise the
parties which were sent out by John.  Javan devoted
all his time and all his energies to the promotion of the
cause which he had espoused, for he still believed that
Simon was the destined instrument in the hand of Jehovah
for the preservation of his people, and the destruction
of all their enemies within and without the city.  His
pious and enthusiastic feelings were highly excited to
indignation at the profaneness of the Zealots and
Idumeans, and the sight of the Holy Temple desecrated by
crime and bloodshed and intemperance, filled him with
a restless and inextinguishable desire for vengeance.
</p>

<p>
Isaac, his former friend, but now most bitter enemy,
knew his strong religious feelings, and the almost
superstitious veneration with which he regarded the sacred
pile, and mourned over its degradation.  The counsellor
had once affected to share and encourage these devout
sentiments, when such a line of conduct seemed to
promote his own interests; but now that he had severed
himself from the popular party, and joined that of the
infidel John, he laid aside the cloak of hypocrisy, and
rivalled the worst of his ruffian associates in acts of
sacrilege and words of blasphemy.  One day, when a
party of Simon's troops were led by Javan to the temple
wall, in order to assault the Zealots with darts and arrows,
he seized on some of the sacred implements used in the
service of the temple, and hastened to insult the feelings
of the zealous young Pharisee, by profaning them to the
most disgusting purposes.  On the knives and pronged
forks usually employed in preparing and dressing the
sacred victims offered in sacrifice, he stuck the mangled
limbs of the human bodies that were strewed around
him in the court, and the brazen vessels he filled with
human blood, and then cast them over the wall, where
they fell at Javan's feet, crying out scoffingly that he
presented him with suitable sacrifices, and holy instruments
for preparing them.  The blood of the fiery Jew
burned at this sacrilegious affront, and deeply he vowed
to be avenged on his insulting foe; but Isaac was now
safe from his wrath, and laughed at his futile rage.
Perchance it might be Javan's turn to triumph ere
long!
</p>

<p>
That evening he returned to his father's house, gloomy
and sad.  Since his entry into the city in Simon's
train, he had seldom visited his home, even at night.
He felt such an irksome restraint in the presence of his
family, particularly of Naomi, that any spot was more
agreeable to him than the home of his childhood, and
he generally dwelt at the palace, of which Simon had
taken possession, as his head-quarters.  On the night
after his religious feelings had been outraged by Isaac,
he repaired to Zadok's dwelling, that he might consult
with his father on the future plans to be adopted by
their party; and having held a private conference with
him, he joined the rest of his family, who were walking
on the terrace at the back of the house.  This terrace,
and the small flower-garden which it overlooked, were
now the only spots where Salome and Naomi could
safely enjoy the open air, except occasionally when they
ventured by the retired lane that ran below the garden,
to visit Mary of Bethezob, and spend some time with
her, in the more extensive pleasure-ground that adjoined
her house.  Even this short distance they never dared
to go unattended by their domestics, who were well
armed; and Mary used the same precaution whenever
she repaired to the priest's house.  She and her little
boy were on the terrace when Javan and his father
passed through the richly-carved marble portico that
opened upon it from the house, and joined the party.
</p>

<p>
All the cheerfulness of social and domestic intercourse
had died away beneath the chilling influence of danger
and dread, and when friends and relatives met together
it was only to relate fresh horrors and anticipate coming
woes.  The spirit of Zadok was yet unsubdued, and his
confident hopes unchecked, by the misery and distress
around him; but his wife did not share his sanguine
feelings, and Naomi remembered the doom which had
been pronounced on Jerusalem by Him whose every
word must be fulfilled.  Therefore she could not cheer
her desponding mother with the prospect of peace and
tranquillity, when she knew that these blessings would no
more be bestowed on her nation until the measure of
their chastisement should be fulfilled, and the Messiah
once more return in glory to rule over his ransomed and
repenting people.  She looked forward to the approaching
crisis with a steady expectation, trusting to the
infinite wisdom and love of her Redeemer, to guard his
own believing children from the ruin that should overtake
his enemies.  But she could not think of the probable
fate of her beloved father and her mistaken brother
without a profound dread.  They as yet despised the
only way of salvation&mdash;and how should they be saved
in the day of calamity?  She daily wept and prayed
before her God that he would mercifully incline their
hearts to receive the truth, and in these prayers she found
her best consolation.  She had now no Christian friend
to whom she could confide her anxious cares, or who
could share her spiritual feelings and spiritual hopes;
but her precious manuscript, the legacy of her beloved
Mary, was an unfailing source of comfort and delight,
when she could retire to her own chamber and peruse
the sacred record.
</p>

<p>
Much of her time also was passed in private
conversation with her mother; for Zadok was seldom able
to remain with her for many hours of the day, and
Salome's spirits were so depressed that her daughter
never left her alone, but exerted her utmost powers to
cheer and support her.  She entered kindly into all the
hopes and fears of Naomi which related to Marcellus,
and rejoiced in the prospect of confiding her to the care
and protection of one whom she had always loved and
esteemed.  She was not so much prejudiced against his
Roman birth as her husband was; and since Naomi had
embraced the Nazarene doctrines, her mother rejoiced
for her sake that she was betrothed to one who would
respect her sentiments.
</p>

<p>
It was not however on the subject of her own prospects
and her own interests that Naomi chiefly delighted
to dwell when conversing with her mother.  There was
another and a higher theme, towards which she drew
Salome's thoughts whenever they were alone; and it
was a source of joy and gratitude to her when she found
that the subject was no longer shunned.  Salome had
formerly avoided all discussions and arguments relating
to the Christian faith, in compliance with the wishes of
her husband, and because she did not desire to be
convinced of the truth of what he so entirely despised and
disbelieved.  Nevertheless, the impression which had
once been made on her mind in favour of the doctrines
of the Nazarenes, by the conversation of Amaziah, and
her daughter, had never been entirely obliterated.  The
heroic constancy and faith that had been displayed in
the conduct of the lamented Theophilus, had also most
deeply interested her; and she could not help thinking that
there must be some miraculous power in that faith which
could thus disarm death and shame of their terrors, and
make its disciples more than conquerors over all that
naturally binds the heart of man to life.
</p>

<p>
When, therefore, her daughter resumed the subject
after her return from Joppa, she was very willing to
listen to her animated discourse.  The more she heard
of Jesus of Nazareth, the more was her gentle spirit
inclined to believe the story of his love to fallen mankind,
and to rest upon it for the peace and safety of her soul.
During the dreary months of fear and horror that
succeeded the entrance of Simon into the city, the
necessary seclusion and retirement in which she and
Naomi lived, gave her ample time to hear and to reflect
on all the wonders that it was her daughter's happiness
to relate, and she did not hear in vain.  The earnest,
the constant prayers of Naomi were heard in her behalf,
and the spark of faith at length was kindled in her
heart.  Faint and flickering it burned, and it seemed
that a single blast of opposition would have extinguished
it; but he who doth not "break the bruised reed, nor
quench the flame of smoking flax," was merciful to this
feeble disciple, and spared her those trials which she
was not yet able to bear.
</p>

<p>
Zadok was fully engrossed by his political and his
priestly occupations; and during the short intervals
which he passed with Salome, he exerted himself to
cheer and encourage her spirits, and chase away the
fears that oppressed her; and he never questioned her
as to the topic of her conversation with Naomi during
his absence, nor did she ever mention it to him.  She
began to feel that the salvation of her soul was concerned
in the question of the truth or falsity of Naomi's
statements, and she would not run the risk of having a
termination put to those discussions that now so deeply
interested her.
</p>

<p>
Some hours had been passed by the mother and
daughter in considering and discoursing on the unhappy
fate of Theophilus, and the believing hope which had
supported him to the end, on the evening when Javan
came from the conflict beneath the temple walls, and
sought the society of his family.  Their conversation
had already been interrupted by the arrival of Mary
and their little favourite David, who was now bounding
along the terrace, and trying to engage Naomi to
pursue him and join in his gambols.  He ran laughing
over the marble pavement, looking back at his young
friend, who exerted herself to banish more serious
thoughts that she might amuse the lovely child, when
his course was arrested by the entrance of Javan and
his father.  They abruptly crossed his path, and the
stern expression of Javan's countenance put a sudden
stop to his mirth and Naomi's efforts at gaiety.  There
was something in the childish look of fear with which
David regarded the young Pharisee that touched his
heart and grieved him.  "Am I," thought he, "an
object of terror to all around me? and do even children
dread my presence?"
</p>

<p>
He stooped down, and raised the little boy gently in
his arms, while he whispered to him, "Why are you
afraid of me, David?"
</p>

<p>
"Because my nurse tells me that you killed poor
Theophilus," replied the child, in a trembling voice.
</p>

<p>
Javan set him down again on the pavement, and a
dark cloud came over his brow.  "Then I am looked
on as a murderer!" he muttered: "this shall not be."
</p>

<p>
He approached his mother and Naomi; and though
they tried to meet him with affectionate cordiality, yet
there was a restraint in their manner, and a quiver on
their lip, that told him plainly how his presence recalled
the memory of the departed Theophilus, and how entirely
the innocent child had spoken their feelings in attributing
to him the death of his cousin.  He was growing weary
of the scenes of strife and bloodshed in which he had
lived since his return to the metropolis with Simon.  His
zeal in the cause of the son of Gioras had not abated,
nor his resolution to dedicate his life, if necessary, to
the restoration of the peace and prosperity of his
beloved city; but when the daily conflict was over, he
had often wished that he could retire to his home in the
confidence of being received as a welcome visitor.  He
longed to find in the society of his family, whom with
all his faults he sincerely loved, a respite from the cares
and anxieties that weighed on his mind, and to forget
for a time the spectacles of horror and vice that met his
eyes while he was actively engaged in carrying on the
siege of the temple, or traversing the streets to prosecute
some scheme of his crafty chieftain's.  The conviction
that he had lost all the esteem which he had enjoyed
among his immediate relatives from his cruel persecution
of his amiable cousin, had made his home disagreeable
to him, and he would have made great sacrifices to
regain his former place in his family.  Perhaps even
now it was in his power to remove a part of the stain
that rested on his character, and to make his sister at
least look on him more kindly.
</p>

<p>
While he was absorbed in reflections that seemed in
some degree to chase away the gloom that had so long
rested on his countenance, Naomi had passed to the
other end of the terrace, in compliance with the earnest
entreaty of little David; and having descended the
marble steps that led into the flower-garden, was occupied
in weaving a chaplet of bright and fragrant flowers
to adorn his curling hair.  Javan followed her, and as
he approached the graceful vase from which she was
gathering clusters of rich blossoms, and contemplated
her sweet countenance, and the animated, joyful face of
the little David, a smile of unwonted cheerfulness played
on his features.  He stood silently by her side until her
task was done, and then sent the delighted child back to
his mother and Salome to claim their admiration of his
flowery crown.  How lovely he looked!  His bright
beaming countenance and joyous spirit seemed to
promise years of innocence and happiness.  Alas! his
beauty was like that of the flowers he wore&mdash;so sweet,
so delicate, and so short-lived!
</p>

<p>
Javan and Naomi walked together in the garden
below until the daylight had faded away, and the stars
of night were glittering in all their splendour in the
dark blue vault of heaven.  The other members of their
family had retired to the house, as they feared the effects
of the night-air on the delicate frame of Salome.  Their
curiosity was greatly excited by the earnest and
protracted conference between the brother and sister; and
when at length they joined them in the cedar-hall, they
were struck with surprise and pleasure at the unusual
degree of cheerfulness that reigned on the countenances
of both; nor did the concluding words of the conversation
which reached their ears, as Naomi and her brother
crossed the adjoining vestibule, give them any clue to
the cause of the change.
</p>

<p>
"For six months, Naomi&mdash;remember, you have given
me your solemn promise."
</p>

<p>
"I will not break it, Javan," she replied, "though
you have put me to a severe trial."
</p>

<p>
The evening meal passed off with unwonted gaiety,
for Naomi, the life and joy of her family, had
resumed much of her former spirits, and her parents
were happy in seeing her so, though they were
ignorant of the cause.

CHAPTER XIX.
</h3>

<p>
Jerusalem had been left in a state of awful suspense
during the interval between the arrival of Titus at
Cæsarea and the march of the Roman army.  But that
suspense soon terminated, when the news was brought
by some fugitives that the countless host were moving
through Samaria, and ere many days could elapse would
be before the walls of the capital.
</p>

<p>
They advanced slowly towards the city, and encamped
in the valley of Thorns, near a village called Gaboth-Saul,
on the hill of Saul, about three miles from Jerusalem.
One evening, while yet the anxious inhabitants
watched from the walls and towers, in expectation of
seeing their invincible foes approaching, they perceived
a single horseman coming swiftly along the valley of
Jehosaphat, bearing in his hand a white flag in token
of his pacific intentions.  He crossed the brook Kedron,
and rode up to the water-gate, where he called to the
officer on guard in the Jewish language, and requested
a moment's parley with him.  The officer complied, and
the gate was cautiously opened, when he saw a young
man of noble and ingenuous aspect, who courteously
saluted him, and begged that he would take charge of a
small packet, which he put into his hand, and permit
one of his men to deliver it safely according to the
superscription.  He also presented him with a gold coin
of great value, with a request that it might be given to
the bearer of the packet, as an inducement to him to be
faithful and swift.  Then he bowed gracefully to the
officer, and retired at full speed from the gate, for he
probably knew that he was in a situation of considerable
danger, and that he might be assailed by the shafts and
spears of the fierce soldiers who thickly covered the wall
above him.
</p>

<p>
The officer retained the gold for himself, for avarice
had spread widely among the corrupted troops; and he
gave the packet to one of his guard, with an order to
carry it as directed.  The man thrust it carelessly into
his vest, and it was not until the following night that it
reached its destination.  Naomi was retiring to rest,
when Deborah entered her chamber and presented to
her the sealed parcel, on which was written, in characters
well known to her, "To Naomi, the daughter of Zadok
the priest;&mdash;with speed."  The curiosity of the old
domestic kept her in the room while her young mistress
tore open the envelope, and hastily perused one of
the two letters which it contained.  Deborah watched
the changing colour of Naomi's cheek, and the tear that
started to her eye, but she did not interrogate her, for
she knew that the manuscript came from Marcellus;
and she retired, leaving the agitated girl to read the
letter again and again, and tremble equally for the
safety of her betrothed, and that of her parents and
herself.
</p>

<p>
The letter of Marcellus contained repeated assurances
of his affection, and his anxiety to rescue his affianced
bride from the danger that was so rapidly coming on
her countrymen.  He detailed the force and numbers
of the Roman army, and declared the firm resolution of
Titus, to persist in the siege until Jerusalem should
be in his power.  And then, with all the eloquence of
love, he besought her to obtain the permission of her
parents to leave the wretched city, and take refuge
under his father's protection.  He added that if she and
her faithful Deborah could escape into the valley of
Jehosaphat, he and Rufus would meet her and escort
her to the camp, where Titus himself had promised to
provide her with a strong guard, and send her in safety
to the dwelling of an honourable friend of his own at
Cæsarea.  Marcellus further expressed an ardent wish
that Salome could be persuaded to accompany her
daughter; but he knew that no consideration would
induce her to leave her husband, and that Zadok would
die a hundred deaths rather than desert his post in the
city at a time of such peril.  He minutely pointed out
the spot where he hoped she would meet him, in her
father's garden by the brook Kedron, at which place he
said that he and his father would wait each night for
her appearance, with a litter and swift horses, to bear
her and her nurse away in safety; and he besought her
to lose no time in making up her mind to the step which
he proposed, as the operations of the Roman army would
be prompt and decisive, and in a few days all possibility
of his rescuing her might be gone.  Much more was
added, and many arguments used to induce the Jewish
maid to leave the home of her fathers, and escape the
inevitable doom of her rebellious countrymen: but it
was all to no purpose.  Naomi shed tears over the
expressions of Marcellus's devoted attachment, and she
felt he had but too much cause to fear that if she
remained in Jerusalem she might share in its destruction;
and yet her purpose was unshaken.  Her mother was in
declining health, and could she leave her?  The light
of heaven was breaking upon her mother's soul through
her means, and could she abandon her?  No; she
resolved that she would not even mention the proposal
of Marcellus to her parents, lest anxiety for her removal
from the city should induce them to urge her acceptance
of it.  She therefore concealed the letter, and opened
the other which accompanied it, and which she found to
be from her poor friend Claudia, who had sent it to her
brother, in the hope that he would find some means of
conveying it to Naomi.  She did not anticipate that he
would run so great a risk as to approach the walls of
Jerusalem himself in order to convey the letter, of
she would never have given him such a commission.
But Marcellus had been too eager to make known to
Naomi his plans for her preservation, and to obtain
her immediate concurrence, for any thoughts of peril
to deter him from the enterprise; and unknown to his
commanding officer, he had ventured to the gate, and
escaped unharmed.
</p>

<p>
The letter of Claudia was nearly to the following
effect:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My beloved Naomi will believe with what satisfaction
I avail myself of an occasion to write to her: and
she will I know be equally pleased to receive tidings of
those who love her dearly.  A friend of Amaziah's is
about to return to Judea, and will take charge of my
letters, and convey them to the Roman camp, from
whence doubtless Marcellus will be able to forward this
scroll to you.  Oh that I could myself be the bearer of
the intelligence which it will contain!  Dear Naomi,
my heart is buried at Jerusalem, and I feel myself a
sad exile while I dwell so far from all those scenes that
are consecrated to my memory.  There have I passed
all the happy days of my eventful life.  There was I
blessed with the affection of my martyred Theophilus;
and there did I hear from him of all the things
pertaining to salvation.  There too I enjoyed your society
and friendship, and could strive to imitate, however
humbly, the piety and virtue and courage that made me
love the religion that you professed.  Can I avoid
looking back with sorrow and regret to the days that
are gone, and wishing that I had been permitted to
tarry with you, and share your dangers?  My life is
now of little value, for all that made life precious is
taken away from me; and it would have been a joy to
me, if the Lord had suffered me to end my days within
the gates of Zion, where he who would have been the
happiness of my life was so cruelly torn from me and
murdered: but it is wrong, and very ungrateful in me,
to speak thus.  Bear with my sorrow, dearest Naomi,
while for the first time I am enabled to give utterance
to all I feel; and do not think that I repine against the
dispensations of my God and Father, though I am
bowed down beneath the weight of his chastening hand.
No; I am enabled to bless that very hand which has
wounded me, and to bear testimony to the love and
kindness that have inflicted the blow; and I can even
pray for mercy and pardon on him who was the cause of
all my sorrow.  I see now that I had made an idol of
my Theophilus.  Even the readiness with which I
received the faith of Jesus was greatly owing to the
interest I felt in all that he taught me, and the
conviction that what he believed must needs be true and
right.  My soul was devoted to him more than to God,
and now God has taken him away in mercy as well as
justice, and has shown me how I leaned on a broken
reed, and neglected the power of His own Almighty
arm.  I believe I can truly say, that my affliction has
been blessed to me; and that I am now, through the
unmerited grace of God, a more sincere Christian than
when you and Theophilus used to commend my docility
and faith.  Oh, may the same grace still support me,
and carry me forward to the end; that I may enter into
the presence of God, clothed in the robe of my Saviour's
righteousness, and be admitted to those realms of joy,
where now my beloved Theophilus has joined the company
of saints and angels, who sing around the throne.
Pray for me, Naomi, that my faith may never fail again,
and that my light affliction, which is but for a moment,
may work for me a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory.  I will weary you no more with the
detail of my feelings; but it has been a relief to me to
express to my earliest and dearest friend both my
weakness and my strength.  In Judith's presence I always
endeavour to restrain my grief, and to cheer her who is
more than a mother to me.  Both she and Amaziah are
unremitting in their kindness; and I must not say that
my life is of no value, when I think of their tenderness
and affection for me.  All the love they bore to their
dear son seems now to be bestowed on me; and if I can
in any measure console them for what they have lost, I
will try to wish that my life may be prolonged.  I have
other blessings and other privileges here, for which I
am grateful.  I enjoy the society of many holy disciples
of Christ, and am permitted to share their worship
and partake of their sacraments; nay more, I have
already frequently seen the most blessed apostle John.
I have looked on that countenance so full of love and
purity and zeal; I have listened to his words, while
admiring crowds stood round in breathless silence, to
catch the now feeble sound; and I have received his
holy benediction, and felt his venerable hands laid
kindly on my head.  How I have wished for you,
Naomi, to share the sacred delight I feel whenever his
almost sacred form is before me!  I cannot describe
him to you, except by saying, that when I look on him
I no longer wonder why he was the chosen, the beloved
disciple above all the rest who followed their Lord.  It
is beautiful to see him leaning on his staff, his long
white hair and beard flowing down upon his breast, and
his eyes sparkling with all the animation of youth,
while he pours forth a torrent of eloquence that must
pierce the heart of all who hear him.  The numbers
that are added to the church here through his preaching
is very great; and the famous image of Diana is robbed
of many of its worshippers.  I blush to remember that I
was once among the ignorant multitude who believe
that this image came down from heaven, and is endued
with divine power.  It stands in a temple, whose
splendour is only surpassed by your own glorious edifice at
Jerusalem.  Oh, that it was dedicated to the worship of
the same only true God!&mdash;and that both were likewise
consecrated to the service of his Son!
</p>

<p>
"This is a very beautiful city, and I was greatly struck
with the splendour of the buildings on our first arrival.
We had a very prosperous voyage from Joppa, and
the weather was more favourable than we could have
expected at that season.  The sun shone brilliantly on
the animated scene which was presented to us as we
approached the city; and the steady motion of the ship,
as we sailed up the river on which Ephesus is built,
enabled me to stand on the deck and admire the beauty
of the scenery on either side.  We ascended the river
for a short distance from the place where it falls into
the bay, and the banks were covered with villages and
noble houses, interspersed with trees of every description.
The broad stream was filled with ships and boats;
and nothing struck us with such feelings of surprise
and delight as the shouts which we heard from some
of the boatmen.  'Hallelujah!' was the cry which these
Christian mariners used to call their companions to
join in their labours; and 'Hallelujah!' was answered
by the ploughmen in the adjoining fields, as the boat
passed swiftly on.  This glorious invitation to sing the
praises of Christ is generally uttered by his disciples, in
the course of their daily employments, as a signal to
their brethren; and we are thankful to be in a land
where the invitation is so frequently responded to in the
same spirit that dictates it, and not followed by insult
and persecution as it would be in Judea.
</p>

<p>
"Our faithful Hannah is well and happy.  She is a
great comfort to us, and tries by her activity and zeal to
make a return to your uncle and aunt for all their
kindness to her: she sends you her most respectful greeting.
Judith and Amaziah salute you and your father and
mother with sincere affection, and join with me in
fervent prayers for your preservation and happiness both
here and hereafter.  Pray, dearest Naomi, remember
and love your attached friend&mdash;CLAUDIA."
</p>

<p>
This letter gave Naomi both pain and pleasure.  She
regretted to find how severely poor Claudia had been
tried, and how much her spirit yearned for the society
of the chosen friend of her childhood, as a consolation
in her present afflictions; but she rejoiced also to
perceive how much of true resignation and submission was
evinced in the heartfelt expressions of piety that were
mingled with the natural complainings of a wounded
spirit.  Oh, how would she have rejoiced to have had
it in her power to minister comfort to her dear and
afflicted friend!  But that task she must leave to the
God of all comfort; and she could only pray that in His
own good time, when sorrow had worked its perfect
work, He would pour balm into the wounded heart, and
bind up the broken spirit.
</p>

<p>
Her next concern was to devise some method by
which she could reply to Marcellus's letter, and put an
end to his anxious expectation of meeting her by the
waters of Kedron.  The fear that he would nightly
repair to the spot, and thus be exposed to great personal
danger, determined her to lose no time in endeavouring
to convey to him her firm determination to share the
fate of her parents, while peril surrounded them on every
side.  Many were the plans which she devised, but all
seemed equally impracticable; and after some hours of
useless reflection, she retired to rest, with a resolution to
apply to Deborah for counsel and assistance.
</p>

<p>
In the morning she summoned the good old nurse,
and told her all her anxious wishes, and her reasons
for concealing Marcellus's letter from her father and
Salome.  Deborah applauded her disinterested conduct
and affectionate devotion to her parents, and entered
warmly into all her schemes for conveying a despatch to
the Roman camp; but none were suggested that promised
any hope of success, until the nurse remembered
that while Mary of Bethezob dwelt in Zadok's house,
her favourite attendant, Reuben, had made many offers
of service to herself and all the family, and had boasted
of having held communication with a certain person in
the Roman army who had been his friend in former
years, by means which were both safe and sure.  This
deceitful man had endeavoured to ingratiate himself with
Deborah, as the best method of discovering any
circumstances relative to her young mistress which he could
communicate to Javan.  So well had he acted the part
of a sincere friend to the family, so artfully had he
feigned sorrow and indignation at the death of Theophilus,
and so judiciously had he mingled the praises of
Naomi with all his discourse, that the unsuspicious old
woman put perfect confidence in his professions, and
now assured her young mistress that she might safely
confide her packet to him, with every hope of its speedily
reaching its destination.
</p>

<p>
Naomi knew nothing of Reuben, except that he was a
confidential servant of Mary's.  She had often remarked
him, and thought his countenance singularly unprepossessing;
but she was entirely ignorant how much of
the affliction and sorrow which had of late visited her
family had arisen from the treachery and cunning of
this very man.  She believed that she must have
mistaken his character, and desired Deborah to see him as
soon as possible, and ascertain whether he still possessed
the power of holding intercourse with his Roman friend,
and would undertake to convey her packet to Marcellus,
for which service he should receive a handsome
reward.
</p>

<p>
Deborah soon performed her errand, and returned to
Naomi with the welcome intelligence that Reuben had
promised to go himself to the appointed spot by the
brook, and meet Marcellus that very evening, when he
would deliver to him the letter.  The despatch was soon
prepared and given to the artful Reuben by Deborah,
with many charges for its safe conveyance.  She desired
him to come the following morning to claim his reward,
and to give an account of his meeting with Marcellus.
The traitor swore to be faithful, and departed.  But
whither did he bend his steps?  To the dwelling of
Simon the Assassin, a name which he had justly earned
from those he came to protect and save.
</p>

<p>
The son of Gioras was engaged in consultation with
Javan and several others of his partisans, when he was
informed that a man at the gate desired to speak with
him quickly and privately.  An expression of doubt and
suspicion crossed his dark brow, and he hesitated for a
moment whether to comply with the stranger's request
or not.  He knew that he was hated by many, and
feared by all; and he had reason to believe that there
were many in Jerusalem who would sacrifice their lives
to rid their city of the scourge that their own folly had
brought upon them.  Yet the man might have tidings
for his ear alone, and his crafty policy had often recourse
to the employment of spies and informers.  He took up
a dagger that lay on the table before him, and placed
it in his girdle, with a look that told how readily it
would find its way to the heart of any one who should
attempt to injure him, and left the hall.
</p>

<p>
Reuben was brought before the tyrant, who waited to
receive him in a small private apartment; and guards
with naked swords stood ready in the anteroom to do
the bidding of their chief.  Simon motioned to the
informer to remain at a distance, and sternly demanded
his errand.  Reuben quailed beneath the fierce scowl
that met his gaze, as he lifted up his own usually
downcast eyes, and showed a countenance as dark and as
artful, but not so bold as that of the assassin.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord," he said, "I come to do you service.
Here is a letter that will tell you how to rid Jerusalem
of one at least of her bravest enemies."
</p>

<p>
He laid the sealed packet on a marble slab near him,
and retired to the furthest corner of the room, for he had
even less desire than Simon to come into close contact
with his companion.  He had intended to stipulate for
a reward of his treachery before he gave up the document:
but there was something in the eye of the son of
Gioras that made him forget his avarice, and think only
of escaping from his presence as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Simon took up the letter, and with his dagger divided
the silken cord that fastened it round, and to which the
seals were attached.  He retained the weapon in his
hand; and while he read the letter he seemed also to
keep a watch on the movements of Reuben, who eagerly
waited for the moment of his dismissal.  The artless
epistle of Naomi proved to the chieftain that his informer
had not deceived him, for the expressions it contained
could not have been the production of cunning or design;
but he did not choose to set the stranger free until he
had both arranged and executed the scheme which his
information had suggested, for he who had betrayed one
trust could not be depended on, even in his treachery.
He called for his guards, and commanded them to take
charge of Reuben, and keep him in security until he
should give further orders concerning him in the
evening.  He desired that he should be well treated,
but not allowed to hold communication with any person
whatever until that period.  The trembling menial now
repented of his treachery, and sincerely wished that he
had never engaged in the business which had brought
him into so perilous a situation; but his faltering
entreaties were of no avail: he was led away and carefully
secured in a chamber by himself, where he was left to
his very disagreeable reflections for many hours.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Simon considered whether he should
make known to Javan the information he had received,
and consult with him as to the best means of seizing
on the unsuspecting young Roman and his brave and
distinguished father.  Javan had on some recent occasions
shown a less sanguinary spirit than he had given
him credit for, and had even pleaded for mercy, where
fanaticism and prejudice were not excited against the
intended victims.  But Simon could hardly doubt of
his willingness to assist in an enterprise that promised
the capture of a Roman officer, who had dared to propose
to a Jewish maid that she should forsake her home
and her parents, and fly to the camp of her country's
foes.  Naomi's letter did not enable Simon to discover
that the writer of it was the sister of his zealous adherent
Javan, for no name was subscribed to it; but it gave
him cause to suspect, from some pious expressions of
hope and confidence which it contained, that the damsel
who thus held a correspondence with the enemy was
a Nazarene, and that he whom she addressed was also
a member of that detested religion.  This circumstance
made him decide on entrusting Javan with the secret,
and he sent to desire his immediate presence.  The
letter was put into his hand as soon as he entered
the room, with a brief explanation of the manner in
which it had been received; and Javan recognised hie
sister's peculiarly beautiful handwriting.  His colour
came and went, and the compression of his lip, and
strong contraction of his brow bespoke the painful
emotions which were excited by the perusal.  Simon watched
his countenance, and wondered at the powerful excitement
depicted there.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! my friend," he said, "this effusion of a Jewish
maiden's love for a Gentile foe moves you to wrath.  It
is well; you will the more readily give me your counsel
and your assistance in punishing the audacious Roman,
and discovering which of the daughters of Zion has been
found so weak and criminal as to bestow her affections
on an infidel.  It is evident that they have long been
acquainted, and have carried on their iniquitous
attachment for a considerable time; but as yet the girl has
resisted the solicitations of the Roman to fly with him
from her parents.  We must secure him, Javan.  We
must secure him this very night, and force him by
tortures to confess what unhappy maiden he has thus
beguiled from her duty as a child of Israel.  And mark
these concluding passages, Javan&mdash;do they not betoken
the writer to be a believer in the crucified impostor, and
that the man she thus so sinfully loves is of the same
obnoxious creed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Simon, I see and comprehend it all.  And this
maiden is my sister&mdash;my beautiful and once holy sister
Naomi, who was then the object of my pride, and the
hope and joy of our family.  I knew that her soul had
been polluted with the vile doctrines of the Nazarenes,&mdash;I
knew also that the childish attachment that once
subsisted between her and the son of Rufus the centurion
was not effaced from her memory by his long absence
from Jerusalem.  But I never dreamed of this shame.
She met Marcellus lately when she went to Joppa with
my father.  I knew it, but I was so much engaged with
public affairs that it passed from my thoughts again, and
I never inquired whether he had sought to gain her
affections.  Indeed the very fact that she had embraced
the Nazarene heresy made me feel secure, for I knew
that she would never bestow her hand or her heart on
any one who differed from her in religion.  I did not
suspect that this Roman infidel would basely pretend to
share her creed in order to obtain her love.  He shall,
however, meet the just punishment of his audacity and
his hypocrisy.  He has affected to be a Christian, and
he shall die the death of a Christian.  Thus shall we
escape all possibility of the disgrace which he would
bring upon us.  My father must be informed of this;
and doubtless he will take decisive measures to prevent
all further correspondence between his daughter and the
Gentile youth, even if we should fail to secure him this
evening.  But, Simon, no injury must be attempted
against Naomi.  She is my sister, and though I love but
few of my fellow-creatures, I do love her.  She must be
spared, and given time to repent, and to save her
immortal soul."
</p>

<p>
"I care not for the foolish maiden," replied the fierce
son of Gioras, "so that we get possession of this bold
young soldier and his father.  I have heard of Rufus,
and I doubt not that his son is as worthy of an enemy's
death as the old centurion."
</p>

<p>
"He always was courageous even to foolhardiness,"
replied Javan; "but he has no deep subtlety or profound
cunning to devise and carry on a plot.  I marvel
how he has deceived my sister, who has so much quickness
and penetration, and made her believe that he has
abandoned his heathen idols, and adopted the no less
impious worship of the Nazarenes.  It is for this that
he must die.  As an enemy to Jerusalem I scorn him,
and the vaunted troop to which he belongs.  Let us go
forth and organize a chosen band on whom we can
depend for our enterprise this evening.  They will meet
with a gallant resistance unless they can fall on these
Romans by surprise."
</p>

<p>
Javan and the chief captain left the house and repaired
to the scene of contest that was almost incessantly
maintained beneath the temple walls.  There, amidst the
noise and carnage that surrounded them, they selected
from among the followers of Simon a strong body of
resolute and powerful men, whom they commanded to
be in readiness at sunset, and to repair at that hour to
the water-gate, where they should receive further
directions, and be led to the spot where their best services
would be required.
</p>

<p>
The intervening hours were passed as usual in fierce
and murderous conflict between the rival factions, in which
nothing was gained by either party, and much blood
and strength were wasted that should have been reserved
for the defence of the city against the common enemy.
</p>

<p>
Before the blazing sun had sunk behind the western
hills the chosen company were assembled at the
appointed gate; and ere long they were joined by their
commander and Javan.  Simon gave the order for the
heavy gate to be thrown open, and they all passed
through and descended to the thick and fertile gardens
that still lay uninjured along the lovely banks of Kedron.
There the men were disposed among the dark trees and
shrubs in such positions as would enable them to
intercept the retreat of any persons who should enter the
garden of Zadok.  The signal was arranged by which
Javan should give them notice to make the attack, and
with the last rays of departing daylight the wily son of
Gioras returned to the city, leaving the execution of the
plot in the hands of his friend.
</p>

<p>
He passed along the dusky streets, now silent and
deserted, for the peaceable inhabitants feared to venture
beyond their own doors after sunset; and those of the
combatants on either side who were not engaged in
keeping a watch on the motions of their opponents, had
retired to seek a short repose after the fatigues of the
day.  The silence was only interrupted by the occasional
shouts of those bands of robbers who nightly issued forth
to commit fresh acts of violence, and strike fresh terror
into the hearts of the wearied and miserable inhabitants.
Simon looked around him as he ascended the narrow
street that led from the water-gate towards the centre of
the town, and when he entered the spacious court in
which his own dwelling was situated, he paused to
contemplate the desolate scene around him.  Not a human
being was moving in that magnificent area which was
wont to be thronged with a gay and busy populace;
but on the pavement lay many a mangled and unburied
corpse, slain by the swords and the daggers of their own
countrymen, and left a prey to the hungry and ferocious
dogs that prowled day and night through the city, and
contended fiercely for the unnatural meal.  Scarcely a
light glimmered forth from the windows of the magnificent
dwellings that composed the square.  Every gate
and every door was closed and strongly barred, to guard
against the intrusion of robbers and assassins; while the
inhabitants sought, in the most retired of their
apartments, a temporary cessation of suffering and alarm.
</p>

<p>
"When," exclaimed Simon, as he contrasted the
present and the past conditions of the glorious city,
"when shall Zion again resume her throne, and sit as
the queen of nations!  Her crown is in the dust&mdash;her
children are in sadness and in shame&mdash;her enemies roar
against her as a young lion.  But they shall not prevail.
The lion of the tribe of Judah shall yet appear in time
to succour her, and her foes shall be driven away as the
chaff before the wind.  Why, O great Messiah! is thy
coming so long delayed?"
</p>

<p>
The son of Gioras was interrupted in the loud expression
of his wild and visionary hopes by the sudden apparition
of the mysterious prophet.  He emerged from the
dark shadow of a neighbouring portico, and attracted
perhaps by the voice of Simon, he crossed the square
and approached him, chanting, in his usual sad, unearthly
tone:
</p>

  "Woe to the bloody and rebellious city;<br>
  And woe to those who dwell therein!<br>
  Woe to thee, Simon!  Woe to the great assassin!<br>
  A voice against Jerusalem and against the temple;<br>
  A voice against the whole people!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe, woe, woe!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Simon's feelings were excited by his own lofty
expectations to which he had just given utterance; and the
boding note of the prophet sounded discordantly on his
ear.  Many times had he heard his voice before, and
once he had cruelly commanded him to be scourged, in
order to silence his melancholy cry, though without the
least effect; but never had his burden of woe sunk
into his own spirit, with a feeling of awe and dread until
night, and he resolved that it should move him
thus no more.
</p>

<p>
"Thy woes be to thyself, thou false prophet," he
cried, "and thy curses light on thine own head!  There,
I send thee to the prince of darkness, whose messenger
thou art; and tell him that Zion defies him, and all the
powers he can send against her.  The Lord of Hosts
is with us."
</p>

<p>
As he uttered this daring and ill-founded boast, he
cast a spear at the son of Ananus, who stood calmly
listening to his words of wrath.  The weapon flew with
violence, and Simon expected to see his victim fall on
the ground transfixed.  But it passed harmless by, as
though the prophet were gifted with a charmed life.
Simon drew his sword, and rushed on the wasted form
before him; but with a speed that mocked his utmost
efforts at pursuit, the son of Ananus fled away, and even
in his flight continued to exclaim:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Woe to the great assassin!<br>
  Woe, woe, woe!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Breathless and exasperated, Simon returned and
entered his house, with vows of vengeance on the man who
had thus denounced him and then eluded his arm.  He
issued strict orders that very night that the wild prophet
should be diligently searched for the next day, and
brought in fetters to his presence.
</p>

<p>
"I will silence his ominous croaking," he continued,
"nor suffer him any longer to go about our city adding
to the terrors of the people, and shaking their faith in
the coming deliverance that is so surely revealed."

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
</h3>

<p>
The Roman army was encamped in all its strength and
glory in the Valley of Thorns.  From the neighbouring
heights the towers and walls of Jerusalem were distinctly
visible, and many times did Marcellus ascend to the
highest summit and gaze with intense anxiety towards
that part of the city where the dwelling of Zadok was
situated.  Oh! what dangers would he not have encountered
to find himself under that well-known roof, and
thus be permitted to protect and save his beloved
Naomi, or perish with her in the destruction which he
well foresaw was rapidly approaching!  It was impossible
for him, under any pretext, to enter the city, and
therefore he had ventured&mdash;though with fears and
doubts as to the reception of his proposition&mdash;to address
to Naomi the letter which has already been mentioned,
and which did not reach her hand until the day after
it was delivered by him to the officer on guard at the
gate.
</p>

<p>
It has been seen what was the nature of her reply,
and how, by the treachery of Reuben, it came into the
possession of the cruel Simon, instead of reaching him
for whom it was intended.  Marcellus hardly hoped that
Naomi would be able to send him any answer, but he
failed not to repair to the appointed spot, accompanied
by his kind-hearted father and a chosen band of soldiers
on the evening of the same day on which he had carried
the packet of letters to the city gate.  Of course he
waited in vain for any communication from Naomi that
night, for his letter was then lying unheeded in the folds
of the careless soldier's garment, and the same
disappointment met him the following evening also.
Nevertheless he was not discouraged, but he resolved to go
again and again to the garden of Zadok, so long as it
was possible for the object of his anxious care to come
forth from the dangers that surrounded her, and claim
his protection.  Rufus also attended his son each night,
that if the maiden should venture to meet them, she
might have the comfort and the sanction of his presence.
</p>

<p>
The third evening arrived; and again Marcellus and
his companions left the camp, and proceeded by a
secluded path over the hills to the valley of Jehosaphat.
The short twilight had almost faded away when they
crossed the brook and entered the garden, and the
overhanging trees, now thick with luxuriant foliage,
effectually concealed them from the observation of the guard
who patrolled along the wall of the city.  They remained
silently watching for some time, when at length they
heard the sound of footsteps softly approaching, and the
name of Marcellus uttered in a low whisper.  The young
soldier paused not to ascertain from whose lips the
welcome sound proceeded; he did not doubt that it was
either Naomi or her attendant who called him, and he
sprang forth to meet her.  The night was cloudy and
dark, and for a moment Marcellus did not discover the
deceit that had been practised upon him.  He saw
indistinctly a group of persons among the shrubs and
flowers, and he believed that his beloved was in the
midst of them, awaiting his approach.  He hurried
forward, exclaiming,
</p>

<p>
"Where are you, my Naomi?  Haste, haste, and let
us bear you away to safety."
</p>

<p>
"Audacious Roman!" replied Javan, fiercely; "Naomi
is safer than with heathens and idolaters.  You shall soon
be within the same proud walls that guard her from
danger, but you shall no more have power to tempt
her by your arts to forget her father's house and her
father's God!"
</p>

<p>
So saying, Javan rushed upon the astonished young
Roman, while his attendants commenced a furious
conflict with Rufus and his followers.  The Jewish party
were the most numerous; but the Romans were superior
in their weapons, and they fought with a desperate
resolution to defend their officers, to whom they were
devotedly attached.  Several were wounded on both
sides, and the noise of the combat attracted the
attention of the guard who were stationed at the nearest
gate.  They quickly assembled in a strong body, and
sallied forth to the assistance of Javan, and in a few
minutes the brave company of Romans must have
been surrounded and defeated, had not Clodius, who
was one of the number, perceived the glancing of the
Jewish army through the trees, and guessed that fresh
enemies were approaching.  The moment he had discovered
that Javan was the leader of their antagonists,
he had rushed towards him, in the hope of revenging
the breach of faith of which the Jew had been guilty
towards him, when he escaped so treacherously from
his custody while a prisoner in the Roman camp.  All
his efforts were directed against him alone, and he
would gladly have sacrificed his life if he could have
slain Javan also.  Probably he would have succeeded
in his desperate attempt, had he not observed the coming
reinforcement; but then his attachment to Marcellus
outweighed his private animosity, and leaving the scene
of conflict, he flew back to the spot beyond the brook
where the horses and the litter had been placed ready
for the expected removal of Naomi beyond the reach of
pursuit.
</p>

<p>
He seized the horses of Rufus and Marcellus, and in
an instant returned to the spot where they were
contending for liberty and life, calling loudly to them at
the same time to mount and fly before the Jewish guard
should arrive and overpower their small band.  They
disengaged themselves from their antagonists, and
sprang on their gallant steeds; but they did not then
desert their devoted followers.  With desperate valour
they covered their retreat, and by the strength of their
well-trained chargers drove back their assailants and
kept them at bay, until they were joined by the band
who came to their aid.  By that time all their own men
were mounted, when, as the Jews rushed forward with
their combined force, Rufus gave the word of command,
and the undaunted troop of Roman cavalry were in a
moment scouring down the valley, far beyond the reach
of their enemies' swords or lances.
</p>

<p>
Javan's rage and disappointment knew no bounds.
All regard to his sister's feelings&mdash;all the compassion
that had once been excited by the fate of Theophilus
and the sorrow of his relatives&mdash;were forgotten, and he
burned to plunge his sword to the heart of the Roman
who had won the affection of Naomi, and escaped the
chastisement which such presumptuous boldness deserved
at the hands of every true son of Abraham.  He
returned with his discomfited followers to the city, and
immediately repaired to the house of Simon, to inform
him of the ill-success of their enterprise.  The chieftain
was almost as much disappointed as his colleague, for he
had ardently desired to get the brave centurion and his
noble son into his power.  But his expectations, and
those of Javan, had failed; and now they could only
endeavour to keep the attempt a secret from Naomi.
Reuben was summoned from his place of confinement,
and made to swear that he would never reveal the
occurrences which had taken place; and then Javan
commanded him to go to Deborah in the morning, as
had been agreed, and claim the promised reward for his
faithful performance of the commission entrusted to him.
He directed him to assure her that he had himself seen
Marcellus in the garden, and given her young mistress's
letter into his own hand, and witnessed his grief and
disappointment at reading its contents.  The wily
Reuben promised to use great discretion and subtlety
in preventing the suspicions of Deborah, and left the
house, rejoiced to find himself again at liberty and safe
from the custody of the terrible Simon.
</p>

<p>
He told his well-invented story to the credulous old
Deborah, who instantly gave him the liberal reward that
was intended as a recompense for his fidelity, and
hastened to communicate to Naomi the supposed success
of her mission.  Naomi was satisfied.  She grieved for
the sorrow which she had caused to Marcellus, but she
felt that she had acted according to the dictates of her
own conscience and her strong sentiments of filial
piety; and she tried to banish all selfish regrets, by
hastening to the apartment of her beloved mother, and
devoting herself as usual to her comfort.  In the effort
to cheer her spirits, which had lately become most deeply
depressed, she forgot all her own peculiar causes of
anxiety, and found a reward for every personal sacrifice
in observing that while she conversed with her, and
cautiously spoke of her own hopes in her Redeemer, and
her own consolation in every trial, the countenance of
Salome became more animated, and her sadness gradually
passed away.  Oh if the interest which her mother
already appeared to feel in the wondrous scheme of
redemption through Jesus Christ might be deepened and
strengthened, and at length, by the grace of God,
become a steadfast and a saving faith&mdash;what joy would
be hers!  How gladly, to further that all-important
object, would she forego all hopes of earthly happiness
for herself, and patiently wait for a glorious reward in
Heaven, where all her cares and sorrows would end, and
where she might be permitted to meet him who now
possessed her affections, to be separated no more for ever!
</p>

<p>
She looked on the pale cheek and wasted form of
Salome, and blessed God that she had refused to leave
her or even to let her know that an asylum of perfect
safety had been offered to her.  Salome expected and
dreaded the result of the attack of the Roman army;
and often she shuddered to think what might be the fate
of her cherished and beloved child if the Gentile
conquerors became masters of the city.  She felt that her
own strength was declining rapidly, and she believed
that ere that terrible event took place her eyes would be
closed in death, and behold not the destruction that ever
attended a Roman conquest.  But how much more
peacefully would she have awaited death if she could
have known that Naomi was safe with those who had
power to protect her and make her happy!
</p>

<p>
All these anxious fears were not concealed from
Naomi, and therefore it was that she refrained from
telling her mother of the letter she had received from
Marcellus.  But she read to her the epistle of Claudia;
and from the expressions of Christian faith and resignation
which it contained, she took occasion to speak of
the blessed peace that was to be found in the Gospel
doctrines, and the support which they afforded to every
sincere and humble believer, under all the most trying
dispensations of Providence.
</p>

<p>
"Naomi, my child," said Salome, with an expression
of anxious doubt on her countenance, "it is from listening
too much to your discourse on those subjects that I
have lost the peace that once possessed my soul.  While
my faith in the holy religion which we have received
from our fathers, and which was taught by God himself,
was unshaken, I was tranquil and satisfied.  I fulfilled
all the requirements of the law as far as I was able, and
trusted to the merit of the appointed sacrifices to atone
for my deficiencies in the eyes of a holy and a merciful
Jehovah.  But now that trust is gone.  I have begun
to feel that the blood of lambs and goats cannot wipe
away my many and grievous sins, and my soul is tossed
with fear and doubt.  I cannot put my confidence in the
crucified Jesus so fully as you would have me do; I
cannot cast myself, and all the burden of my sin, on him,
in full assurance of pardon, for my faith in him is very
weak.  Oh that I could surely know that he was indeed
the promised Messiah!"
</p>

<p>
"My dearest mother," replied Naomi, "I bless my
Heavenly Father for the words you have spoken.  Surely
He hath begun the work of salvation in your soul, and
He will accomplish it to the end.  Your very doubts
and fears are an evidence that his Holy Spirit is striving
with you; and I shall yet see you among his believing
people, enjoying that peace which was the gift of Jesus
to his disciples, and which nothing in this world can
either give or take away."
</p>

<p>
"May God grant it, Naomi," said Salome, in a dejected
tone, "but I never expect to feel perfect peace on earth.
I have lived for many years in contempt of the Saviour
whom you would have me to worship, and serve, and
love as a God.  And if he is indeed the Christ, how
can I hope that he will pardon my past neglect, and
accept a faith so poor and weak as mine?  I shall not
live to prove whether it is sincere or not; and I dare
not say that if I met with persecution or even opposition
for his sake, I should have strength to confess him and
to maintain my belief.  Oh no, Naomi; my heart is
not like yours or our poor Theophilus's&mdash;and Jesus must
despise it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh say not so, dear mother," said Naomi: "you
have more faith in your Redeemer than you allow yourself
to believe.  Were it not so, you would not be so
anxious to be pardoned and accepted by him.  And
were your doubts tenfold more powerful than they are,
Jesus would not turn his face from you, for he has
promised to receive <i>all</i> who come to him in sincerity,
and in no wise to cast them out."
</p>

<p>
"While I hear you tell of his condescending mercy
and love to sinners, I always feel comfort, Naomi: but
when I am alone and remember my own utter unworthiness,
then I doubt whether that mercy and love can
extend to me.  I have sinfully neglected him, and even
striven to banish from my mind the impression that long
ago your conversation and that of Amaziah made on
me.  I feared to displease your father more than the
God of my salvation; and preferred a blind confidence
in the superiority of that religion which he professed,
to a diligent inquiry into the truth of the Christian
doctrines.  I did not even at that time pray that I might
be led into the right way, for I wished to remain in the
Jewish faith; and can I hope that such perverseness
should be forgotten, and such hardness of heart pardoned?
O Naomi, I have suffered much in the last few months.
I do believe that the Lord has been striving with my
spirit, though I resisted his influence; but day by day
that influence has become stronger, and my desire to
know the truth more urgent.  While you and your father
were absent at Joppa, I gave much time to meditation;
and I believe I was sincere in asking my Heavenly
Father to bring me to himself, and make me his own
accepted child, however trying to flesh and blood might
be the means which his love and wisdom should see
necessary to wean my soul from all its false dependencies,
and its attachment to the things of earth.  I prayed
also that the true way of acceptance with him might be
made known to me; and that I might be taught to
renounce all that was erroneous in the manner in which
I had hitherto worshipped Him, and enabled to discover
and embrace that faith which would make me pure in
his eyes, and meet for the kingdom of Heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Then I no longer wonder, my dearest mother, that
you have taken such an increased interest in the truths
of our holy religion since that time.  God has heard
your prayer, and graciously inclined your heart to receive
the light of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ.  I have
greatly rejoiced ever since my return home, to find
that you not only permitted me to speak unreservedly
of my Lord and Saviour, but that you took delight in
the subject, and always seemed to be cheered and
enlivened by it; but I did not know that this was in
answer to your own supplications.  Oh, I thank our
merciful God who gave you the spirit to ask so humbly
and sincerely, and then in his love and mercy granted
your request."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Naomi, it is all his work.  If at last I am saved
through Jesus Christ, what a monument of his goodness
shall I be!"
</p>

<p>
"And is it not equally a miracle of grace, that any
one of us should be saved?" replied Naomi.  "Are not
all of our fallen race by nature dead in trespasses and
sins, until the Spirit of the Lord takes away our stony
heart and gives us a heart of flesh?  What pride, and
presumption, and self-righteousness once defiled my
whole soul; and yet did my Saviour call me to believe
in him, and enable me to trust wholly and unreservedly
to his merits for pardon and salvation!  I have never
known a single believer in Jesus who did not look on
his own salvation as a wonder of grace and mercy, and
those who have attained to the greatest degrees of holiness,
and have been enabled in some degree to imitate the
perfect example set forth by their Divine Master, have
ever been those who have also most deeply felt their own
natural depravity, and most gratefully acknowledged
that all their attainments here, and all their hopes hereafter,
were the free gift of God.  Do not then, dear mother,
doubt his power and willingness to save you: 'If the
blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an heifer
sprinkling the unclean, sanctify to the purifying of the
flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who
through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to
God, purge your conscience from dead works, to serve
the living God!'"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my child, I believe indeed that Jesus has the
power, and I will try also to believe that he has the will,
to save and pardon even me.  It is a wonderful thing
that God should give his Son to die for us: and if that
be really true, nothing is too great to expect from his
love towards his sinful creatures."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, eternal thanks be to God," exclaimed Naomi,
fervently, "for this confession of your faith in Jesus, as
his Son, and your own Saviour, my mother!  May he
strengthen that faith day by day, and enable you to
triumph in his great salvation."
</p>

<p>
"Naomi," replied Salome, "it is not in my nature to
feel all that holy trust and confidence that seems to
inspire your more ardent soul.  While I remain in this
world, I shall ever be subject to fears and timorous
doubts.  But pray for me, that my faith may not
altogether fail&mdash;that I may be enabled to take comfort
in it when the hour of death approaches, as it surely
will ere long."
</p>

<p>
Naomi turned away to hide the rising tear that
dimmed her eye at her mother's prophetic words.  she
was well assured that they were words of truth; and
she had for some time past endeavoured to prepare
herself for the bereavement that was rapidly approaching
her; but she could not contemplate it without deep
emotion, or watch the silent change that was taking
place in that beloved mother's pallid countenance and
wasting form, without feeling that all her trust in God
would be required to enable her to bear the separation.
</p>

<p>
She paused a moment to regain her composure, and
then replied,
</p>

<p>
"If it pleases our God and Father to take you to
himself, he will support your faith, my mother, and
give you victory over every fear and every temptation.
Trust in Him, and Him alone, and he will be your
guide ever unto death.  His rod and his staff they shall
comfort you; and while you lean on Him for support,
he will not suffer your foot to slide."
</p>

<p>
"Bless thee, my child," said Salome affectionately;
"what a comfort has God given me in you!  Nothing
has so strongly shown me the power and the holiness of
the religion which you now profess, as the change
which it has worked in your character, and the spirit
of joy and consolation and meekness and gentleness
that it has imparted to you.  When we meet hereafter
before the throne of God, it will be my pride to
remember that you, my Naomi, pointed out to me the way
thither, and your bright example allured me into it."
</p>

<p>
"Cease, cease, dear mother!" cried Naomi: "oh,
do not thus rob God of the honour that is all his own,
to give any part to a sinful creature like me.  If he
has been pleased to make me the humble instrument of
revealing to you the way of salvation by faith in Jesus
Christ, to Him be all the glory and all the praise.
Throughout eternity I will bless Him for the privilege,
and declare my own unworthiness.  Oh that I had
grace and strength to act up to the spirit of those
doctrines which I so feebly endeavour to impart to you!
But I have need of teaching on every point; and
were it not for the grace of my Redeemer, and the
power of his Holy Spirit, I should fall into sin each
hour of my life.  How many are my provocations of
Him every day, notwithstanding all his mercy to me!
It is only by constant prayer that my sins may be
blotted out afresh, and washed away in his atoning
blood, that I can in any degree preserve my confidence
that I am pardoned and accepted by Him.  Let me
entreat you to use the same humble means, and you too,
my mother, will find rest to your soul, and be enabled to
glory in the hope of your free forgiveness and everlasting
glory."
</p>

<p>
"I have already found some consolation in prayer,
Naomi, since I have offered it in the name of Jesus.  I
can feel more confidence that God has pardoned me,
when I am enabled to believe that his only Son has
shed his blood to take away my sins, than when I
trusted in the blood of sacrifices to make a propitiation
for them.  I see now that those sacrifices could never
take away sin."
</p>

<p>
"They were but the types and shadows of the good
things to come," answered Naomi, "and served to point
out the one great sacrifice which should at length be
offered.  I would to God that our deluded nation would
now see the worthlessness of all those forms and
ceremonies that belonged to the old covenant, and would
heartily embrace the new covenant which the blessed
Son of God has revealed to mankind.  It is a grief to
my heart, a bitter grief, to see my dear and honoured
father and my zealous brother yet in the bondage of
the law, and despising the glorious liberty of the
disciples of Christ.  Their souls are in subjection to things
which cannot profit them; and the zeal and devotion
that would do honour to the cause of Him who died to
save them, are devoted to the support of vain traditions
and customs that are derived from men.  They think to
glorify Almighty God by their obedience to these
customs of our fathers, but how much more acceptably
would they honour Him by casting off their prejudices
and receiving Jesus of Nazareth as his anointed Son.
O my dearest mother, will not you exert your influence
to bring both my father and Javan out of the
way of error?"
</p>

<p>
"I dare not speak to them on such a subject, Naomi.
The words would die away unuttered.  I am too weak
in body and in spirit to contend with them, and they
would but despise my feeble voice.  Perhaps also their
arguments would shake my own faith, which is so little
established.  I will pray for them, my child, as you have
prayed for me; and may God give the same success to
my petitions."
</p>

<p>
Naomi forbore to urge her mother to attempt the
conversion of Zadok and her son, for she saw how unequal
she was to such an effort.  Indeed the conversation
which she had just held with her had exhausted her
strength and excited her feelings more than she was
well able to bear; and her daughter entreated her to
seek repose on a couch which was always placed for her
upon the terrace.  This was a favourite situation with
Salome, as it enabled her to enjoy the pure air that blew
over the mountains of Olivet and the lovely view that
extended beneath them.  The terrace also was adorned
with many a marble vase, in which grew beautiful
and aromatic plants; and these were carefully tended
by Naomi, and arranged near her mother's resting-place.
It was a peaceful spot in the midst of that
turbulent city; but even there the distant shouts of
violence and conflict were heard, and Naomi brought
her harp, that by its music and her own sweet voice
she might draw away her mother's attention from the
sounds of discord that always excited her fears and
her grief.
</p>

<p>
She continued to sing in a low, gentle tone, until
Salome, soothed by the sound and refreshed by the
breeze, sank into a quiet sleep; when Naomi laid aside
her harp, and indulged in grateful meditation on the
discussion which she had just held with her mother.
It is true the faith which she had heard her express
was both weak and wavering&mdash;clouded with doubts and
obscured by prejudices.  Yet it was evident that she
was sincere in her inquiry after the truth, and really
desirous of knowing the will of her Heavenly Father,
that she might do it.  Therefore Naomi was very
confident that her mother would not be long left in
uncertainty as to the way in which she should seek the
salvation of herself; for Jesus himself had said, "If
any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine
whether it be of God."  What comfort did the remembrance
of this promise bring now to the heart of Naomi;
and how earnestly did she thank her merciful Redeemer,
who had left such words for the encouragement of all
who seek him in sincerity, however small their knowledge
or weak their faith!  She trusted that her beloved
mother would yet be spared for some time, and enabled,
before she should be called hence, to make a full
profession of her trust and confidence in the merits of
her Saviour.  She hoped that when her last hours
should arrive they might be cheered and illumined by
such a sense of pardon and acceptance as should
deprive death of all its terrors, and make her more than
conqueror over all that now she greatly dreaded; and
that then, when life was fading away, and eternity
appeared in all its awful reality, she might be able to
lay aside her fears and scruples, and tell to Zadok on
what her soul was trusting, and whence she derived her
peace and joy.  But should it please the Lord of life
and death to hasten her mother's departure, and deny
her the privilege of bearing a triumphant testimony in
her dying hours to his power and will to save sinners,
yet Naomi felt that she should have no fears for her
salvation&mdash;no doubts that when her flesh and her heart
failed, God would be the strength of her heart and her
portion for ever.
</p>

<p>
"O God!" she softly ejaculated, "I thank Thee for
this blessed hope!  May I but hold my own faith
steadfast unto the end of my pilgrimage; and then, when I
stand before Thy throne, I shall see my mother, my own
beloved mother, among the countless throng that shall
assemble there, having washed their robes and made
them white in the blood of the Lamb!  But where, oh,
where will my father be found in that great day? and
where shall Javan stand?  Can it be, O Lord Almighty! that
their blindness shall exclude them from Thy
presence?  Shall they suffer the wrath of the Lamb if they
continue to despise his mercy?  O Lord God, Thou
knowest.  Thou knowest how much of their blindness is
wilful, and whether their hearts are upright in Thy
sight; and Thou art very merciful."
</p>

<p>
Naomi buried her face in her hands, and wept.  She
could pray and hope for the conversion of those she
loved so dearly, but the present state of their souls made
her shudder.  She knew that a heavy judgment was
coming speedily upon Jerusalem&mdash;the hand of the
avenger was already stretched forth to smite the city
and her inhabitants; and there was but one way opened
for escape&mdash;but one refuge into which sinners might
flee and be safe for ever.  That way was despised by
Zadok, and hated and blasphemed by Javan&mdash;how could
it then avail to save them?  Naomi could not look into
the decrees of God, or foresee what His providence
should ordain concerning her father and brother.  She
could not look into their hearts and discover the degree
of their responsibility and their guilt.  She could only
bow in trembling submission to His just decrees, and
pour out her soul in fervent supplication that they might
yet repent and be converted, ere the days of destruction
should come, and there should be none to help them.
She was still engaged in deep and anxious thought
when Salome awoke, and looked up at her daughter
with a smile of greater contentment and peace than
Naomi had seen on her countenance for several months.
</p>

<p>
"I have been dreaming of former happy days," she
said, "when you and Javan and our poor Theophilus
were merry children playing together on this terrace; and
Claudia and Marcellus were with us too.  I was thoughtless,
and well pleased to be so, at that time, Naomi;
but I am happier now, in my present weak, declining
state, with sorrows, and cares, and miseries around me,
than I ever was while I was ignorant of what Jesus has
done for my soul.  I dreamed just now that I saw you
all in childish mirth, playing among the flowers at the
end of the terrace; and while I looked at the joyous
group, a bright and glorious being descended from
above, and called to Theophilus to come out from the
rest of his companions and prepare for Heaven.  How
joyfully the boy complied! and how gratefully he looked
up to Him who had thus chosen him for himself!  Then
the heavenly visitant summoned you, my Naomi; and
with equal readiness you left your childish sports, and I
saw the light that shone from the divine countenance of
him who called you reflected in your own.  Marcellus
and Claudia were both afterwards summoned: and I
looked to see my son also placed in the chosen band;
but no&mdash;he stood aloof, and though the same voice of
mercy called to him, he did not move.  The glorious
being turned from him with a look rather of sorrow than
of anger, and then he spoke to me.  I did not heed his
words at first, and many times he called me ere I even
tried to rise and obey; but at length he came and took
my hand and drew me forward, and placed me by your
side.  O then my eyes were opened, and I saw a multitude
of angelic creatures around us, clothed in white;
and they sang a song of triumph, because the Lord of
their salvation had looked in mercy upon us also, and
had joined us to their happy company.  I looked for
Javan and for Zadok that I might call them to join us,
and share our felicity, but I could not see them&mdash;the
terrace and all that I had seen before had vanished
away; and then I woke with a feeling of peace that
I have never known before.  O Naomi, I believe that
I shall soon realise that happy vision, and that all I
love best on earth will be partakers of the same joy.
If I did not trust that Zadok would surely be of the
number, I fear that even the prospect of Heaven would
not now make me feel satisfied.  And Javan too&mdash;my
poor mistaken son!  His errors of faith have led him
into grievous sins.  May the Lord pardon him the death
of Theophilus!  Your father's life has been one of
devoted obedience to what he believed to be the will of
God, and of unwearied benevolence to his
fellow-creatures.  Surely he will be accepted of the Lord,
though he may die in ignorance of Him for whose sake
alone his sins are pardoned and his obedience rewarded.
But Javan gives me far more anxiety.  His zeal is so
mixed up with cruelty&mdash;his temper is so unhumbled&mdash;and
his conduct so fearfully opposed to the love and
mercy and charity that ought to characterize all
pardoned sinners, that I cannot think of him without fear
and dread.  Oh, in what part of God's revealed will
did he learn to persecute his own brethren?  Where
did he read that it was an acceptable offering to the
Lord of all goodness to shed the blood of one who
dwelt at peace with him, and worshipped the same
God, and hoped for the same Heaven, though he
differed from him as to the foundation of those hopes?"
</p>

<p>
"May his spirit be enlightened to see his errors,"
replied Naomi; "and may he yet find pardon.  He
was less cruel to Theophilus than you believe, mother.
He thought he was making a last effort to save the soul
of our poor cousin from the devices of Satan.  I fear
that much of personal animosity was mingled with that
feeling, and urged him to execute his fatal enterprise
against his liberty; but I do believe that his anger
was softened and his hatred subdued after Theophilus
was in his power.  And when he saw his noble conduct,
and witnessed his unshrinking courage, I do believe
that he pitied and admired him, and regretted the
step into which his own misguided zeal had hurried
him."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did he not save his life, Naomi?  Surely
he had power to obtain his release."
</p>

<p>
"Alas, mother, pride and fanaticism forbade his openly
pardoning a Nazarene, even if his hard-hearted
colleagues would have consented to it.  But speak to him
on the subject, and hear his own feelings and his own
thoughts; and you will pity him more, and perhaps
blame him less."
</p>

<p>
As Naomi spoke Javan himself appeared on the terrace.
His father had met him, actively engaged in the
business of the civil warfare, and had told him with
deep sorrow that his mother was far less well than when
he had last seen her, and that he began to entertain
very serious alarm about her.  Javan was shocked at
this announcement, for he really loved his mother; and
though he had seen her look pale and feeble for some
time past, he had not admitted the idea that her life was
in danger.  He eagerly inquired of Zadok whether the
rabbi Joazer, who acted the part of a physician as well
as of a spiritual adviser, in the family, considered her
illness in so serious a light, and whether any further
medical aid could be obtained in the city.
</p>

<p>
His father assured him that everything was done for
the invalid that human skill could devise, but that he
feared her naturally delicate constitution had suffered so
much from sorrow and anxiety, that she would never
rally again, though she might yet linger for a considerable
time.  This, he added, was also the opinion of the rabbi.
Javan's heart smote him, for he remembered how much
he had contributed, by his conduct towards Theophilus,
and also by his harshness to Naomi, in harassing the
mind of his gentle and affectionate mother, and laying
on her a heavy burden of woe, which she had not
strength to bear.  He hastened homewards, and when
he reached his father's house, of late so seldom visited by
him, he felt a degree of remorse while he thought how
he had been a cause of constant sorrow to its inmates,
instead of being their support and joy.  He proceeded
to the terrace with softened feelings, and approached his
mother with a kindness and gentleness of manner that
were very unusual.  Encouraged by this, Salome
conversed freely with him; and Naomi, seeing that sha
looked tranquil and happy, left her with her son, while
she retired to attend to some domestic arrangements with
Deborah.
</p>

<p>
The conversation that ensued on her departure, between
Javan and his mother, was extremely interesting; and
whatever was the subject of it, it tended in a great
degree to remove the gloom that hung on Salome's
spirits; and Naomi found her more cheerful on her
return than she had ever been since the apprehension
of Theophilus, and all the sad scenes which had followed
that unhappy event.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
</h3>

<p>
Marcellus and his father reached the Roman camp in
safety on the preceding night, when they escaped from
the plan laid by Simon and Javan for their destruction.
As they descended the hill that lay between Jerusalem
and the Valley of Thorns, the vast encampment lay
before them like a fortified city.  A large space had
been cleared and levelled by the pioneers; and there, in
an incredibly short time, the camp was formed according
to the usual plan of the Roman army.  It was an exact
square, and surrounded on every side by a strong rampart
about twelve feet high, the top of which was armed
with a line of almost impenetrable palisades; and a ditch,
twelve feet wide and twelve deep, also ran at the foot
of the rampart as a further security.  These prodigious
works were executed by the soldiers themselves, who
were accustomed to use a spade or a pickaxe with almost
as much readiness as a sword or spear, and were always
kept employed in some useful manner by their
commanders when not engaged in the actual duties of
warfare.  A vacant space of two hundred feet in width was
left inside the ramparts, and the tents were pitched in
the remaining portion of the vast enclosure.  They were
arranged so as to form broad and straight streets, and
in the centre of the whole rose the lofty and magnificent
pavilions of Titus, ornamented with the emblem of
the eagle, so sacred in the eyes of every Roman soldier.
A strong tower had been already erected at each corner
of the camp, and the intervening space withinside the
rampart was lined with scorpions, catapultas, balistas,
and other ponderous and dreadful engines of destruction.
A handsome gate was placed in the rampart on
each side of the encampment, sufficiently wide to admit
the broad and heavy waggons and military carriages
that attended the movements of the army; and also of
strong detachments of troops sallying forth with
unbroken ranks.
</p>

<p>
The strictest order and decorum were preserved
throughout this populous camp, which were rigidly
enforced by the general and his subordinate officers.  The
soldiers were summoned by the sound of trumpets to
their regular meals, and the same signal warned them
when it was time to retire to rest, or to arise and begin
the business of the day.  The clear blast of the evening
trumpet was sounding through the camp when Rufus and
Marcellus entered the gateway; and ere they reached the
quarters of Titus the wide streets were almost deserted,
and none remained abroad except those whose duty it
was to patrol the different districts, and keep watch while
their comrades slept.
</p>

<p>
The expedition in which Marcellus had that night
been engaged was known and permitted by the general,
with whom he was a great favourite.  Titus had listened
with considerable interest to the story of his
attachment to the young Jewess, and would willingly have
done anything in his power to rescue her from the
dangers to which she must soon be exposed; but no
open measures could be of any avail, and he could only
hope that the scheme of his young friend might be
crowned with success.  He allowed him to take from
the ranks of his own troop such a number of men as he
might think sufficient for his purpose, and gave orders
that he and his attendants should be permitted to pass
unquestioned through the gates of the camp at any
hour, either of the day or night.  He had sympathized
in the disappointment of Marcellus, when on the two
preceding evenings he had repaired to the garden in the
Valley of Jehosaphat, and returned without any tidings
of Naomi; but he encouraged him in his determination
to visit the appointed spot on each following night, and
wait in patient hope for better success.  All that hope
was now gone, and Marcellus hastened to his kind
commander to communicate to him how all his expectations
had been frustrated, and his fears that Naomi might
even be subjected to oppression and restraint, in
consequence of the discovery which had been made by her
brother of his unsuccessful attempt to rescue her from
impending evil.
</p>

<p>
The young soldier and his veteran father were
immediately admitted into the presence of Titus, who was
busily engaged in looking over plans and maps of
Jerusalem and the surrounding country, and revolving in his
mind the plans of future proceedings, and the best mode
of commencing an attack on the rebellious city.  He
ceased from his employment on the entrance of his
visitors, and heard the account of their meeting with
Javan with attentive interest, and sincere commiseration
with the mortified feelings of Marcellus.  The only
consolation which he could offer him was in the prospect
of a speedy vengeance on the crafty Jew, and the
possibility of saving and rescuing Naomi when the Roman
arms should have conquered Zion, and a way should
be opened for their entrance within her proud walls.
But Marcellus knew that much of danger and suffering
might befall his beloved Naomi long ere the courage
and obstinacy of the Jews should be subdued, and the
eagles glitter on the conquered towers of Jerusalem.
He knew the unyielding and determined character of
their opponents better even than Titus did, and he
anticipated a long and desperate resistance to all their
efforts.  He shuddered at the idea of Naomi being
exposed to all the privations and miseries, all the horrors
and excesses of a besieged and vanquished city; and
he retired to his own tent for the night, with feelings of
anxiety and dread that effectually banished sleep from
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
The signal for rising and engaging in active employment
was welcome to him; and after the first and most
solemn occupations of the day had engaged his attention
in the retirement of his tent, he gladly went forth
among his comrades, and tried to forget his own personal
anxieties in the zealous performance of those duties
which fell to his lot in the discipline of the camp.  It
was the custom in the Roman army for all the soldiers
to repair in the morning to the centurions of their
respective bands, and offer to them a respectful
salutation.  The centurions paid the same compliment to
the tribunes, and they in their turn waited on the
general or commanding officer, to proffer their services,
and receive from him the watchword for the day, and
the orders which they were to deliver to their inferior
officers.  These forms were attentively observed in the
camp of Titus, and the tribune who presided over that
part of the army to which the equestrian troop was
attached, was commanded to prepare six hundred
horsemen for an expedition to reconnoitre the wall of the
city that morning.  He was also desired to inform
Marcellus that his attendance was required in the general's
tent.  He gladly obeyed the summons, for he hoped
to be allowed to take a part in the intended movement;
and any occupation of that kind was preferable to passing
his time idly in the camp, and indulging his own painful
reflections.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-389"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-389.jpg" alt="THE ESCAPE OF TITUS.">
<br>
THE ESCAPE OF TITUS.
</p>

<p>
He was not disappointed, for Titus immediately
communicated to him his plans, and desired him to be in
readiness to accompany him, as his personal attendant, in
an hour's time.  They sallied forth at the hour appointed,
a gallant band of horsemen, splendidly mounted and
equipped, and soon appeared on the summit of the
heights that looked on the walls of Jerusalem.  As they
wound down the last declivities that sloped at the foot
of the walls they gazed in astonishment at the turbulent
city.  Not a man appeared upon the battlements&mdash;not
a sound of preparation for resistance or attack was
heard; even the gates seemed to be deserted, and that
scene of violence to be hushed in perfect peace and
repose.  Titus led his squadron to the right, and passing
the angle of the wall which was guarded by the Women's
Tower, to the north-east of the city, he filed off towards
the Tower of Psephina, which occupied an important
situation on the north-west side, near the upper fountain.
Suddenly the gates behind him were thrown open, and
a vast multitude rushed tumultuously forth, and threw
themselves upon the troop of cavalry.  Some succeeded
in passing the squadron, and placed themselves across
the road by which it was advancing, and others burst
violently through their ranks and separated their enemies
into two parties.  Titus was cut off from the remainder
of his troop, with Marcellus and a few other brave
followers.  He could not advance, for the ground before
him was divided into orchards and gardens, fenced round
with walls and deep ditches, besides broad watercourses
that reached to the walls of the city.  To retreat was
almost as impossible, for thousands of his assailants
crowded between him and his troops, to intercept his
movements in that direction.  Titus saw that the only
chance of escape lay in a desperate effort of strength
and courage.  He called loudly to his men to keep close
to him, and with Marcellus at his side he urged forward
his noble steed and charged fiercely on those who
opposed him.  Hundreds of javelins and arrows were
discharged at him, and every effort was made to obstruct
his passage and secure his person; but though he wore
neither helmet nor breastplate,&mdash;for he had not
anticipated that he was going forth to battle,&mdash;yet he did
not receive a single wound, but passed through the
cloud of missiles unharmed.  With his sword he cleared
a passage before him, while his well-trained charger
crushed beneath his feet the wounded enemies who fell
around.  Marcellus bravely seconded him, and thus did
they cleave their way through the dense mass that
surrounded them and shouted for their destruction.  The
undaunted courage of Titus and his young companion
excited the admiring wonder of the Jews.  They exhorted
one another to rush forward and secure the inestimable
prize that seemed within their reach; yet still they shrank
away from the rapid strokes of his bloody sword and
the irresistible force of his fiery steed, as he slowly and
steadily made his way through the crowd.  His band
of devoted followers formed around him as well as they
could, and with a trifling loss the party at length reached
the Valley of Thorns, and escaped from their pursuers.
Two only were missing from this brave company&mdash;one
had been surrounded, and with his horse pierced with
countless arrows and javelins&mdash;the other dismounted
incautiously, and was instantly overpowered and slain,
and his horse led away in triumph into the city.
</p>

<p>
The exultation and joy of the Jews at this event were
unbounded.  It is true but a small advantage had been
gained, yet they regarded it as the happy presage of
future victory.  Titus himself, the noble and all-conquering
Titus, had been forced to fly, and nothing now
seemed too great for their hopes and expectations.  The
news ran through the city with the speed of lightning,
and the superstitious inhabitants hailed it as a token
that the Lord would give them the victory, and that
His arm would now be stretched out to save them.
Javan shared the general enthusiasm, and with his pious
father gave thanks to the God of Israel for this token of
his favour and protection; and Simon thought it politic
to encourage the same feeling among his troops.  In his
own cold calculating heart he trusted more to the strength
of his army than to the invisible arm of Jehovah; but
he knew that the Jews, however sunk in sin, and regardless
of the laws of the God and their fathers, yet looked
on themselves as his own peculiar people, whom he would
save and defend from all those who sought their ruin.
Therefore he joined with Zadok and his ardent son in
openly ascribing the late signal success to the special
interposition of their Heavenly Father, and in exhorting
his men to courage and perseverance, under the assurance
that the Divine aid would attend all their efforts, and
enable them to baffle every attempt of their foes to
deprive them of their freedom or their inheritance.
</p>

<p>
Zadok returned to his home that evening full of bright
hopes and holy confidence, and he endeavoured to inspire
Salome and his daughter with the same feelings, but in
vain.  Naomi ever remembered the sad prophetic words
once uttered by her Lord and Saviour, and she knew that
the ruin of Jerusalem was drawing nigh.  Salome too
had learnt from her to believe that not one jot or tittle of
what he had pronounced should ever pass away unfulfilled;
and her own naturally timid and desponding disposition
had made her more readily assent to the truth of his
declarations of punishment and woe, than to his promises
of pardon and acceptance.  She could easily believe that
her nation should be brought low and her beautiful city
destroyed, for the wickedness of them that dwelt therein;
but she could not so easily apply to herself the equally
clear assurance that those who put their trust in the
Lord should be safe under the shadow of his wings&mdash;that
those who believed in the Son of God should be
cleansed from all sin&mdash;pardoned, justified, saved, and
glorified, without any merit of their own, or any claim
on the mercy of an offended God, but a simple reliance
on the atonement of his Son Jesus.
</p>

<p>
Salome's heart was weak, and when Zadok looked to
see her pallid countenance lighted up with joy at the
account which he gave her of her people's triumph, he
was grieved to observe her turn away and weep.  Gladly
would she have told him all her fears and all her anxieties,
but her courage failed her, and she could only show by
her dejection that she was insensible to the hopes of
temporal glory and prosperity that animated her
husband's breast, and unable to reveal to him the eternal
hopes that, however dimly and faintly, cheered her own
spirit and lightened her earthly sorrows.  Zadok
attributed her depression of spirits entirely to her present
weak state of health, and he gently reproached Naomi
for not using better endeavours to amuse her mother's
mind, and at the same time regretted that he was so
much occupied in the discharge of his sacred duties, and
in the affairs of the city, as to have but little leisure to
devote to his wife.  Had he suspected the subject which
formed the chief and constant theme of discourse between
Salome and his daughter during his absence from home,
he would still more deeply have regretted the state of
public affairs that had compelled him to leave them so
much alone, and expose his beloved wife to a danger
which he regarded as far more to be dreaded than any
temporal evils.
</p>

<p>
He had contented himself with the conviction which
he entertained of Salome's pious attachment to the
religion in which she had been brought up, and her
implicit submission to his judgment in all spiritual
matters.  He also felt assured that her mind was not of
that active and inquiring nature that would lead her,
like Naomi, to investigate any new opinions or receive
the truth of any new doctrines.  He knew that she had
a great veneration for the rabbi Joazer, and had always
considered his opinion as a rule of faith; and when he
requested him to watch over her bodily sickness, he also
charged him to lose no opportunity of strengthening and
establishing her spiritual health.  Thus he believed that
he had no cause to fear that the heresy he so much
dreaded would ever be communicated to her, and he
was well satisfied that the devoted affection of Naomi
should watch over her, and provide for her every comfort
and attention that her present precarious state of health
required.  Little did this priest of the Most High God
understand the power of that faith which he despised.
Little did he know of those influences of the Holy Spirit
which can change the whole nature of the soul, and
infuse a thirst after the truth that nothing else can
satisfy.  Little did he know of that strength of the Lord
Jesus, which is made perfect in our weakness, and which
was then silently and gradually working in the soul of
Salome, transforming her weakness into strength&mdash;her
fears into holy confidence&mdash;and inspiring her with such
an assured hope of pardon and eternal bliss as should at
length shine forth resplendent amid the struggles of
departing life, and make her triumphant over all that
hitherto she had trembled to contemplate.
</p>

<p>
As yet this power from on high was not perfected in
her soul, and she was in bondage to the fears of death
and the occasional dread of God's wrath; and
notwithstanding all the efforts which Naomi made again and
again to chase away her fears and fill her with humble
trust in the promised support of her Heavenly Father,
and the atonement once offered on the cross to wipe
away all her sins, she was subject to frequent temptations
and doubts, that clouded her views and marred
her peace.
</p>

<p>
Zadok knew nothing of all her spiritual trials, and he
frequently talked to her of the joys that would be her
portion, if it pleased the Lord to remove her from this
world of care, and the reward that would follow her
constant obedience to His laws, and her humble trust in
His mercy towards His chosen people.  But the ground
of his hopes was not that on which Salome had learned
to rest, and the humility which she had acquired at the
foot of the cross made her shudder at the spirit of
self-confidence that tarnished the piety even of the upright
Zadok.  Night and morning he prayed with her, and
repeatedly he read the Scriptures to her: but the form
of his supplications, however earnest, now sounded
imperfect in her ears, and his comments on the word of
inspiration grieved her heart.  Oh, could she but have
heard him, who was dearer to her than all the world
besides, pouring forth the desires of his heart in the
name of Jesus of Nazareth&mdash;could she have heard him
acknowledge the "Man of sorrows" to be Him of whom
Moses and the prophets did speak, how joyfully could
she have borne every other trial, and even, she thought,
have encountered death with a smile, in the assured
hope of his following her to those mansions which
Christ has prepared for his disciples!  And yet she
could not at that time command her faltering tongue
to declare in whom she believed, and entreat her
husband to seek refuge in the ark provided for the
day of calamity.
</p>

<p>
The evening passed away in the usual unsatisfactory
manner; and the following day brought with it events
that occupied Zadok's attention even more than before,
and engrossed even more of his time.
</p>

<p>
Titus had returned to his camp in the Valley of
Thorns, greatly exasperated at the unexpected attack
which had been made on him, and determined to lose
no time in commencing the siege of the offending
city.  During the night he was joined by one of the
legions which he had left at Emmaus, and orders were
immediately issued for the removal of the camp to a
place called Scopus, within a mile from the outer wall,
and so situated as to afford a fine view of the city,
and of the level plain which extended to the base of the
fortifications.
</p>

<p>
At break of day the business of removing the army
and all its ponderous equipments commenced, and was
performed with all that astonishing expedition and
order that distinguished every movement of the
well-trained Roman armies.  Orders had been given the
night before for the men to be in readiness; and soon
after the sun rose, all the tents were taken down and
packed in the waggons, with the rest of the heavy
baggage.  Then the first signal-trumpet blew, and at
its sound the troops all fell into their ranks, each
carrying their arms, their kitchen furniture, and their
instruments for constructing fortifications.  The second
trumpet sounded, and instantly fire was set to temporary
bulwarks and towers that had surrounded the encampment,
and quickly they formed a blazing mass of ruin.
The third and last signal sounded loud and long, and
then the herald, who stood by the side of Titus, raised
his voice, and demanded whether the troops were
prepared for battle; and he was answered by a cheerful
and universal shout of assent.  Three times he repeated
the same demand, and each time the deafening shout
of the armed multitude replied to him, while the hands
of the troops were raised on high to express their
readiness and zeal.
</p>

<p>
The word of command was given, and that glorious
array of invincible men marched simultaneously forward.
Alas! that such a goodly assembly should be moving in
all their pride and pomp towards the slaughter of
millions of their fellow-creatures, and the destruction of
the noblest and most sacred city that ever adorned the
earth!  The army advanced in the usual order of
march: the allies led the way attended by the company
of pioneers, and then the baggage of the officers, escorted
by a strong guard.  Titus himself followed with a select
guard of spearmen and the cavalry belonging to the
legions.  The military engines, strongly guarded, formed
the next detachment; and to these succeeded the sacred
standards, attended by the trumpeters; then the
legionaries in their phalanx, ten deep; the slaves with the
baggage; and, last of all, the mercenary troops, with a
strong rear-guard to keep order.
</p>

<p>
The equipment of this fine army was as admirable
as the order and discipline that marked its movement.
Nothing vain or superfluous was to be seen in the dress
or ornaments of either the men or their officers; while
at the same time it was evident that the Romans knew
the value of a certain degree of show, and endeavoured
to produce an imposing effect upon their adversaries.
The accoutrements of the officers were superb and
costly: their helmets, cuirasses, and swords were inlaid
with silver and gold, and their beautiful and spirited
steeds were richly caparisoned; while the common
soldiers prided themselves on their well-polished shields
and helmets.  The numerous gilded banners which
attended the army, in addition to the glittering eagles,
increased the brilliance of the scene; and the whole of
that numerous army looked rather as if they were attired
and equipped for a public feast, than as if carnage and
desolation were their only objects.
</p>

<p>
The Romans formed a second encampment near
Scopus, two legions being in front, and a third at some
distance in the rear; and while they were erecting their
walls and towers of defence, the tenth legion, which had
taken its route by Jericho, also arrived, and received
immediate orders to pitch their tents at the foot of
the Mount of Olives, facing the lofty temple walls and
pinnacles.
</p>

<p>
Each of the leaders of the rival factions in the city
beheld the hostile camps forming under their walls.
Eleazar looked from the summit of the temple, John from
the porticoes of the outer courts, and Simon from the
heights of Zion; and for the first time they all became
aware that their only chance of safety lay in a united effort
to repel their formidable enemies.  They entered into
negociations of peace; and at length agreed to lay aside
their mutual animosities, and combine their now divided
forces for a simultaneous attack on the common foe.
Zadok and Javan hailed this tardy reconciliation as a
second omen that the Lord was on their side, and that
he had inclined these fierce and hitherto implacable
enemies to forget their personal hatred, and only contend
with a valiant emulation who should be foremost in
rushing on their assailants.  Joyfully did the son of
Zadok obey the call to arms, and hasten to join his
leader.  He was at his father's house when the summons
reached him.  He had returned to his home in search of
a part of his armour for the expected sally; and Salome
heard with trembling fear the call for her son to join his
comrades.  She gave him a mother's parting blessing;
and when he was gone from her sight, she passed the
anxious hours that succeeded in fervent prayers for his
safety.  How earnestly did she beseech her Heavenly
Father to spare his life, and not suffer him to be hurried
into eternity while his soul was a prey to evil passions
and baneful prejudices!  Naomi united in her mother's
supplications; and while they were thus engaged, a
fierce and bloody scene was going forward in the Valley
of Jehosaphat.
</p>

<p>
The combined forces of Jerusalem had sallied out by
the eastern gates, and rushing along the margin of the
Kedron, had fallen with unexpected and irresistible fury
upon the tenth legion, then busily occupied in
constructing their camp.  The soldiers were at work in
their intrenchments, and many of them were unarmed.
They retreated before the sudden attack of the Jews,
and several of them were killed before they could regain
their arms.  Fresh swarms of their assailants still poured
from the city, and in their consternation the Romans
yet further multiplied their numbers.  Accustomed as
they were to fight in battle-array, they knew not how
to resist the wild desultory attacks of the Jews, who
rushed upon them with a blind impetuosity.  Sometimes
they turned and faced their pursuers, and succeeded
in repulsing them for a moment and slaying the
foremost; but such overpowering numbers followed to
take their places, that the brave legionaries were on the
verge of a total defeat, when Titus, who had heard of
their danger, came suddenly to their relief.  He was
attended by a few picked men, and fell so unexpectedly
on the Jews that he drove them up the valley with
considerable loss.
</p>

<p>
The tenth legion now rallied, and united with the
troops that followed Titus in pursuing the enemy along
the valley; but notwithstanding the disadvantage to
which the Jews were exposed, from the steepness and
inequality of the ground, they yet had the courage to
turn and face their pursuers after they had crossed the
brook.  In this situation they maintained the battle till
noon, when Titus placed a part of his forces at the end
of the valley, and sent the rest to occupy a strong
position on the heights above, in order to secure the valley.
This movement was mistaken by the Jews for a retreat;
and a sentinel who had been posted on the walls, made
a signal to those within the city that the Romans had
fled.  Instantly a fresh multitude issued from the gates
with the undisciplined fury of wild beasts, and bore
down the ranks of their enemies by the impetuosity of
their charge.  They fled to the mountains, and once
more Titus and his chosen band of attendants were left
exposed to the attack of the infuriated multitude.  He
was posted on the declivity of the hill, when he found
himself deserted by the main body of his forces; but
taking advantage of his commanding situation, he
defended himself resolutely, while Marcellus and his
comrades endeavoured to ward off the blows that were aimed
at him on every side.
</p>

<p>
One of the Jews, who had distinguished himself
throughout the engagement by his intrepid courage,
advanced through the crowd of his countrymen to the
spot where Titus and his brave company stood like lions
holding the inferior animals at bay.  With a desperate
effort he broke through the Roman band, and aimed a
deadly blow at their general.  So wild and sudden was
his attack, that he would probably have succeeded, at
least in wounding Titus, whose attention was directed
another way, but for the courage and activity of
Marcellus.  He saw the descending blow, and quick as
thought he sprang between his commander and the
fierce Jew, and arrested the weapon ere it reached
the destined object.  The flashing eyes of the Jewish
soldier fell upon him who had thus robbed him of the
triumph so nearly won, and Marcellus saw that he
was again brought hand to hand in conflict with the
brother of Naomi.  Revenge was a passion that lurked
deep in Javan's heart, and now it rose up to animate
him against the young Roman.  He forgot his eagerness
to rush upon the general, in the hope that now
he had found an opportunity of obtaining vengeance
for all the injuries that his prejudiced mind laid to the
charge of Marcellus.
</p>

<p>
With a bitter curse on his lips, he turned to aim his
sword at the heart of the Christian soldier, and was
astonished at the strength and dexterity with which his
attack was met by his opponent.  Marcellus would not
for worlds have slain the brother of his beloved Naomi,
and he contented himself with warding off the fierce
blows of Javan.  Had this single combat been permitted
to continue for any length of time, Marcellus must have
been driven either to seek the life of his antagonist, or
to save his own by a retreat, for Javan was resolved
to die or to conquer.  But happily they were forced
asunder by the rush of combatants on either side, and
they met no more in that day's battle.
</p>

<p>
Those of Titus's troops who had gained the summit of
the hill, and saw the enemy come pouring up on either
side, and attacking their noble general and his faithful
band with determined fury, were struck with horror at
the critical situation to which they had abandoned him.
By a loud outcry they raised an alarm among the whole
legion, and spread the information that Titus was
surrounded and in danger of being massacred.  Bitterly
they reproached one another for their desertion of their
brave commander; and with the resolute courage of
men ashamed of their conduct, and resolved to make
amends for it, they rallied their scattered numbers, faced
their pursuers, and by their determined valour at length
succeeded in driving them down the hill.  Every foot of
ground was well contested by the Jews, but they could
not long stand against the force of the Romans bearing
down upon them from above in a solid phalanx, and
they were compelled to retreat, entirely discomfited.
Titus remained to establish a strong and efficient line
of outposts, and then retired to his camp, and dismissed
his wearied men to seek repose after the lengthened
struggle which they had been compelled that day to
maintain.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
</h3>

<p>
It was now the time of the passover; and though the
festive joy that was wont to pervade the once happy
and favoured city at that sacred season was gone for
ever, yet even in these days of calamity the hallowed
festival still retained its hold on the hearts of the people
of Judah.  Formerly the whole population of the land
used to repair with joyful feet to their holy and beloved
city, where they found every house open to receive
visitors with a free and cheerful hospitality.  This
thronging of the sons of Israel to offer up their united
praises for the deliverance of their forefathers from the
bondage of Egypt could now no longer be effected; yet
great numbers still repaired at the accustomed period
to the metropolis, undeterred by fears or obstacles from
attempting to accomplish what they regarded as a
solemn duty and privilege.  They found an entrance
into the city, but to retire from it was impossible, and
this vast addition to the population of the place only
increased the misery of the besieged, by hastening the
consumption of the provisions that were yet stored up
for the day of want.
</p>

<p>
The recurrence of this holy feast at such a time of
civil disorder was also the occasion of other calamities,
by causing the rupture of the recently established peace
between the factious leaders of the city.  The great day
of sacrifice arrived.  The priests were at their stations,
and all was ready for the celebration of the sacred rite.
Eleazar commanded the gates of the inner temple, where
he still kept his quarters, to be opened for the
of the worshippers; when a party of John's most
desperate adherents stole in unperceived among the crowd
with swords and other weapons concealed beneath their
cloaks.  No sooner were these ruffians within the gates
than they cast aside their cloaks, and brandishing their
swords, fell upon the defenceless multitude, who expected
that a general massacre would follow.  The Zealots
suspected that the stratagem was designed entirely for
their destruction, and leaving the gates undefended,
they all fled away and took refuge in the subterranean
chambers beneath the temple.  The helpless crowd who
had assembled to worship the Lord God of Israel now
gathered around the sacred altars for protection; but
even the sanctity of those hallowed spots was insufficient
to preserve the fugitives from the violence of the
Zealots.  Many were trampled to death, and a still
greater number slain either in mere wantonness and
cruelty, or to gratify private hatred.  The altars flowed
with blood, but it was not the blood of the appointed
victims shed for the expiation of the sins of the people.
It was the blood of human beings, poured forth by the
hands of murder and sacrilege, to fill up the measure
of Zion's iniquity, and call down the vengeance of an
insulted God!
</p>

<p>
At length the fierce partisans of John of Gischala
were glutted with robbery and carnage; and having
taken possession of the inner apartments of the temple,
they made terms of peace with their enemies who were
concealed beneath.  They permitted them to come up
from their places of refuge, and even to resume their
arms, and remain under the nominal command of their
leader Eleazar; but in fact they became a subordinate
part of the faction attached to John, and thus the sedition
which before was divided into three parties was reduced
to two.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Titus was slowly and cautiously advancing
towards the city.  He posted in the camp at Scopus a
sufficient body of horse and foot to guard against the
incursions of the enemy, and then he employed the rest
of the army in levelling the whole space between the
place of encampment and the Tomb of Herod, near the
pool called the Fishpond of Serpents.  All the fences and
verdant hedges that enclosed the orchards and gardens
were torn up; and those beautifully luxuriant spots
where the inhabitants of Jerusalem had enjoyed so
many hours of recreation, were swept away by the
merciless hand of war.  The trees were cut down, and the
clear fountains filled up with rubbish, that a broad and
level road might be constructed from Scopus to within a
short distance of the outer wall of the city.
</p>

<p>
Simon was not idle during this interval; and as he
was unable to meet the advancing foe in a pitched
battle, he had recourse to stratagems, by which he hoped
to obtain some advantage, however small.  He placed
the enterprise under the conduct of Javan, as the most
daring and faithful of his officers; and the zealous young
Jew readily accepted the command.  To the astonishment
of the Romans they one day beheld a considerable
body of the Jews issue rapidly from a gate near the
Women's Tower, as if forcibly driven out by a stronger
party within.  They supposed that this band consisted
of the fiercer insurgents, and that they were expelled
by the party who desired peace.  This idea was
confirmed by a number of Jews appearing on the wall,
holding out their hands, and making every sign that
they would willingly receive the Romans, and open
their gates to them.  At the same time they cast down
stones upon those whom they had driven out, and who
were cowering beneath the wall as if dreading the
approach of the enemy, and supplicating mercy from
their countrymen.
</p>

<p>
The Roman soldiers who beheld this transaction were
about to charge in a body, but they were restrained
by Titus, who suspected some artifice, and commanded
them to remain at their posts.  A small detachment,
however, who were in front of the rest, employed under
the inspection of their centurion Rufus, seized their
arms and rushed towards the wall.  Rufus, himself, in
the ardour of the moment, forgot the attention to
discipline for which he was usually remarkable.  He
recognised the hated and perfidious Javan among those who
now seemed exposed to destruction; and with a strong
desire of vengeance for all his cruelty and want of faith,
he sprang forward with his unsuspecting men.  The
Jews, who had advanced to meet them at some distance
from the wall, now fled to the gates, and were followed
by the inconsiderate Romans, until they found themselves
within the flanking towers.  The artful Javan
and his companions then turned upon them, while
others sallied forth and surrounded the little band, and
those on the walk hurled down stones and other missiles
on their heads.  They suffered a considerable loss in
killed and wounded; but some of them escaped, with
Rufus, fighting a valiant retreat, and pursued by the
enemy as far as the monument of Helena.  The Jews
then retired, exulting in their victory, and when they
reached their walls they insulted the vanquished Romans
by clashing their shields and loading them with every
ludicrous and opprobrious name, for their folly in being
so easily deceived.
</p>

<p>
The proud spirit of Rufus was roused to the uttermost
at these taunts, and he fiercely cast them back
at Javan, with threats of future vengeance.  For the
present, however, that vengeance was beyond his reach,
and he was forced to lead back the remnant of his men
to the camp, greatly discomfited at their defeat and loss.
Nor was this all, for they were received with severe
reproofs by their tribune for their breach of discipline;
and so great was the displeasure of Titus that he
threatened to execute upon the offenders the martial law,
which punished even such breach of orders with death.
This announcement caused great sorrow throughout the
army, for Rufus and his brave men were deservedly
loved and respected by their comrades; and all the
officers immediately gathered round the general to
implore his mercy.  For some time he sternly refused
to listen to their entreaties, and it is probable that he
might have carried his harsh sentence into effect, as
a warning to the rest of the army, had it not been for
the earnest intercessions of Marcellus.  The grief of his
young friend and favourite, and the high opinion which
he had always entertained of Rufus, at length appeased
his anger; and he pardoned the offence of the centurion
and his band upon their pledging themselves to
atone for the error by a strict attention to regularity
and discipline for the future.
</p>

<p>
This act of lenity increased the popularity of the
general, and the devotion of the army to his service.
With fresh vigour they proceeded to carry his schemes
into execution, and in four days the whole space from
Scopus to the wall was levelled, for the conveyance of
the baggage and removal of the camp.  The army took
up their position among the northern and western walls;
the infantry in front, the cavalry in the rear, and the
archers between them.  With this impenetrable line
between the city and the camp, they removed in perfect
safety all the heavy baggage, and Titus encamped
within a quarter of a mile from the outer wall, near the
Tower of Psephina.  Another detachment of the army
was posted near the Tower of Hippicus, at some
distance from head-quarters, and the tenth legion kept its
position near the Mount of Olives.
</p>

<p>
At this period Jerusalem was divided into different
quarters, which might almost be termed distinct cities,
each inclosed in its own walls, and all surrounded by
the great outer wall, which was guarded with towers of
solid masonry, of the same kind as that which composed
the rest of the fortifications.  The first or outer wall
encompassed the northern quarter called Bezetha.  It
was built of stones thirty-five feet long, and so massive
as to offer an almost impenetrable obstacle even to the
powerful battering-rams and other formidable engines
of the Romans.  It was erected by King Agrippa the
First, and though it fell far short of his original design,
it was yet a work of great power and strength, being
upwards of seventeen feet in height, and the same in
thickness.  The Jews had carried it up to the height of
thirty-five feet, but not with the same stability as that
part which was built by Agrippa, and the summit was
furnished with battlements and pinnacles, which gave
it a still greater elevation.
</p>

<p>
The second wall enclosed a part of the lower city, and
joined the north-west corner of the strong citadel of
Antonia.  This fortress was built on a high rock, and
was separated from Bezetha by a deep ditch.  It stood
at the north-west of the temple, and with that beautiful
and commanding edifice composed a separate and
independent portion of the city.
</p>

<p>
The most ancient part of the walk was that which
surrounded Sion, the southern quarter of the town, and
containing the strong pile of buildings called the City
of David.  It passed along the verge of the Valley of
Hinnom, and then turning northwards, joined the eastern
portico of the temple.
</p>

<p>
Thus the city was calculated to resist the strength and
perseverance of almost any army that could be brought
against it, being composed of four distinct quarters, each,
it would seem, able to stand a regular siege independent
of the fate of the other portions.
</p>

<p>
The towers which guarded the whole of this circuit
were thirty-five feet high, and of the same width.  On
their summits were lofty chambers, less solidly built,
which were again surmounted with large tanks to receive
the rain-water.  There were in all a hundred and sixty-four
of these massy towers, the ascent to which was by
handsome flights of steps; and the space from tower
to tower being about three hundred and fifty feet, the
whole extent of the walls must have been rather more
than four miles.
</p>

<p>
Titus ascended the most elevated height in the
neighbourhood of the camp, attended by Marcellus and some
other of his officers, with a strong escort of cavalry.  He
wished to obtain a commanding view of the celebrated
city which he was destined to overthrow, so that not one
stone should remain upon another.  Had he known what
was to be the fate of that splendid city, he would have
regarded it with other and more melancholy feelings.
The intimate knowledge which Marcellus possessed of
the interior enabled him to point out to his admiring
general the situation of all its various quarters, and the
most distinguished buildings.
</p>

<p>
The fortress of Antonia, and the snowy walls of the
temple adorned with burnished gold, attracted the
immediate attention of Titus, and long he gazed on the
wonderful pile, where art and wealth had expended all
their treasures.  The citadel rose conspicuous above
the temple, on a steep rock ninety feet high.  The
body of the tower was seventy feet in height, and it
was finished at each corner by lofty towers.  It was
provided within with every accommodation that luxury
could require, and was fitted rather for a royal palace
than a garrison for troops.  The temple itself appeared
a fitting edifice to contain all the countless treasures
that had once been lavished on its altars and its walls
by the piety of the sons of Zion, and which, in spite
of the frequent depredations that had been committed
by foreign and domestic foes, were still of surpassing
value.
</p>

<p>
Titus surveyed all this magnificence, and the many
other noble and extensive buildings that lay before his
view; and then he proceeded, with some caution, to
make an entire circuit of the city.  Nicanor, the tribune
who had so greatly distinguished himself at Jotapata,
was one of those who followed the general, and by his
side rode the liberated captive Josephus.  The Jew
expressed an ardent wish to approach the walls and
address his countrymen, who were watching their
movements from the battlements and towers; and Nicanor
imprudently consented to accompany him, in the hope
that their united persuasions might have the effect of
inclining the besieged to listen to terms of peace.
Josephus made an eloquent appeal to them, describing the
power and valour of the Romans, and vaunting also
the clemency and generosity of Titus towards those who
submitted to his arms.  But while he was yet speaking,
and extending his arms towards his countrymen, as if
to implore them to have pity on themselves, one of
those on the wall aimed an arrow at his breast, at the
same time assailing him with the epithets of coward and
traitor.  The shaft did not reach its intended mark, but
it pierced the arm of Nicanor, who stood close to
Josephus, and inflicted a severe wound.
</p>

<p>
Titus was highly exasperated at this act of wanton
cruelty and insult, which plainly showed that all attempts
at bringing about terms of capitulation would be in vain,
and he instantly resolved on commencing the siege
without any further delay.  He gave orders to his soldiers
to ravage and destroy the suburbs, and to bring away
everything that would be serviceable in raising their
mounds and completing their works.  All the trees were
quickly cut down, and the suburbs, lately so blooming
and beautiful, became naked and desolate.  Titus resolved
to make his first attack on the outer wall which
surrounded Bezetha, because the buildings of that quarter
did not reach to the wall, which consequently appeared
lower.  The spot which he selected was near the tomb
of John the high-priest, and immediate preparations
were set on foot.
</p>

<p>
When the inhabitants of Jerusalem beheld the Roman
works being completed, and saw that the day of assault
was near at hand, those who had hitherto been entirely
occupied in destroying their own fellow-citizens, began
at length to turn their attention in the direction of the
Romans&mdash;the foes alike of every faction&mdash;and the more
peaceable inmates enjoyed a temporary repose from
their outrage and violence.  Many of them even hoped
and prayed for the success of the Roman arms, as the
only means by which they could be rescued from the
power of enemies far more to be dreaded.
</p>

<p>
The force under the command of Simon consisted of
10,000 of his own men, and 5,000 Idumeans; John of
Gischala had 6,000; and 2,400 owned Eleazar as their
leader.  The son of Gioras allowed himself and his
followers no respite to their labours.  With vast exertion
they succeeded in raising the military engines, formerly
taken from Cestius, on the walls; but his men wanted
skill to use them with much effect, and the Romans
continued their labours under the shelter of their
penthouses of wickerwork.  Being also more practised in
the use of the destructive catapultas and balistas, they
greatly annoyed the besieged, and not only repelled
their frequent sallies, but cast over the walls stones of an
enormous size from the distance of two furlongs.  These
masses of rock carried death and ruin in their track, and
the Jews knew not how to guard against them; but as
they were generally of a very white colour they were
enabled to see them approaching, and numbers of men
were placed on the wall to watch for these silent and
deadly enemies.  These sentinels gave notice to their
comrades the moment they perceived the stone leave
the engine, by crying, "The bolt is coming!" when
they immediately separated, and threw themselves flat
on the ground, so that the rock generally passed
harmless over them.  This stratagem was observed by the
Romans, and they afterwards took the precaution of
blackening the stones, which completely baffled the
besieged, and rendered these tremendous implements
fearfully destructive.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the great terror and loss occasioned
by these engines, the Jews did not suffer their enemies
to proceed undisturbed with the mounds which they
were erecting, but were incessant in their sallies, and
in the artifices which they employed to interrupt their
labours.  All their efforts were, however, unsuccessful,
and the works were speedily completed.  Then the
engines were brought to a proper distance from the
walls, and strongly guarded against the excursions of
the besieged.  The signal was given, and at the same
moment a thundering noise resounded through every
part of the city.  On three different parts of the walls
the battering-rams were let loose together, and terror
ran through the heart of almost every dweller in Jerusalem.
The soldiers of the besieged city raised a general
and terrific shout, in reply to the first strokes of the ram;
and all private animosities, all party feuds, appeared to
be forgotten in the dreadful excitement that ensued.
Convinced that nothing remained but to unite all parties
in the common cause, Simon proclaimed an amnesty to
all of John's adherents who would join his men in
defence of the wall; and though John was himself too
suspicious of his rival leader to venture out of his
stronghold, yet he did not oppose his followers obeying the
summons.  The two factions combined in their efforts to
set the engines on fire by discharging combustibles
from above, while strong parties sallied from the gates
below, tore away the palisades and killed many of the
engineers.
</p>

<p>
Titus was unwearied in his exertions.  Wherever
assistance and counsel were wanted, there was he to be
seen in person, and his courage and presence of mind
equalled his activity.  His personal inspection and
encouragement excited his troops to fresh exertions, and at
length a tower which stood at an angle of the wall came
down beneath the blows of the battering-ram; but its fall
made no breach in the walls.  The besieged drew back as
if in terror at this event, and the Romans were
unsuspicious of any immediate attack, when suddenly a large
body of the enemy rushed out from a gate near the
Tower of Hippicus, and fell upon them with resistless
fury and impetuosity.  They were furnished with flaming
brands, for the purpose of setting fire to the engines, and
they soon reached the intrenchments.  Had they not
been most valiantly opposed by a party of Alexandrians,
they must have succeeded in destroying all those dreaded
machines; but while they struggled fiercely with their
opponents round the engines Titus came galloping up,
attended by his cavalry.  With his own hand he laid
twelve of the Jews dead on the ground, and the rest at
length retreated, leaving one of their number a prisoner
in the hands of the Romans.  This unhappy man was
immediately made fearful example of, being crucified
before the walls, in the hope of deterring his countrymen
from making any more such desperate sallies.  He was
the first&mdash;would that he had proved the last!&mdash;of these
rebellious people who was treated with such cruel and
unjustifiable barbarity, and made to endure those
torments which their fathers had inflicted on the innocent,
the holy, the divine Jesus of Nazareth.  But the fate of
this victim to Roman severity did not in the least degree
deter his fellow-citizens from exposing themselves to the
same perils, whenever they could hope to gain the most
trifling advantage over the enemy.  They continued
the conflict until night put an end to their efforts, and
the Romans retired to their camp exhausted with the
severe exertions of the day.
</p>

<p>
With the morning dawn the battle was renewed, and
again the terrific sound of the battering-rams came like
thunder on the ears of the besieged.  One of those
dreadful engines had been named by the Jews "Nico,"
or "The Victorious," for they observed that nothing
seemed able to resist the overwhelming strength of its
blows.  The dreaded Nico continued to work with
unabated vigour throughout the day, and at night it ceased
not to thunder against the wall, until at length it began
to totter.  When the Jews saw that a breach was to
be apprehended, they forsook the wall, and abandoned
all further attempts at defending it.  The showers of
darts and arrows which their enemies were able to pour
down upon them from the lofty towers which they had
erected to overlook the battlements, had for some time
forced them to descend from the summit of the wall,
and leave the battering-rams to continue their
destructive blows without any effort to interrupt them.
They were also wearied with exertion, and anxious to
return to their own houses within the second wall, and
therefore they deserted the suburb, and left Bezetha
an easy prey to the conqueror.
</p>

<p>
Those of the inhabitants who still remained in that
quarter fled to the more secure parts of the city, and
the gateways were thronged with terrified fugitives,
carrying all that was portable of their possessions, and
hurrying from the expected incursion of the Romans.
The confusion and alarm that already prevailed in the
city were augmented by this sudden influx of a destitute
population, who were entirely dependent on the charity
and hospitality of their fellow-citizens for shelter and
subsistence.  These social virtues had almost expired in
that miserable city, while selfishness and avarice reigned
triumphant on every side.  Few were found willing to
receive and comfort their distressed brethren, and the
sufferings of these wretched people were extreme.  But
some individuals were yet remaining in Jerusalem in
whose hearts all the better and nobler feelings were not
extinguished, and who gladly offered an asylum to as
many of the fugitives as their dwellings would contain.
Among these Zadok was the most distinguished, and
his benevolence set a bright example to the rich and
noble of the city.  Several families were brought under
the shelter of his roof, and received from the hands of
Naomi and Deborah all the assistance and relief that
their destitute condition required.
</p>

<p>
Salome was at this time but little able to support the
constant excitement of terror in which she lived from
day to day; and the appalling sounds that reached her
ears told her sinking heart that the destined ruin was
approaching very nigh.  Naomi had hitherto used every
precaution to conceal from her mother the progress
that the enemy was daily making, and the slaughter
that was effected among their countrymen.  It would
but have augmented her terror and her grief, and added
to the constant anxiety which she felt from the perils to
which both Zadok and Javan were exposed.  But when
Bezetha was abandoned to the conqueror, and the
inhabitants rushed tumultuously into the inner city,
mingled with the troops, and uttering wild cries of
terror, the truth could no longer be disguised, and
Salome learnt that the Roman eagles were even then
being planted on one of the walls of Jerusalem.  Soon
the whole of the deserted quarter was in the possession
of the enemy, and Titus having ordered a large portion
of the outer wall to be thrown down, took up his position
near what was called the Camp of the Assyrians.  His
troops commenced an immediate attack on the second
wall, and were resisted with dauntless courage by the
Jews.  John and his party maintained the conflict from
the citadel of Antonia and the northern porticoes of the
temple, while Simon's men defended the wall as far as
the aqueduct that passed to the Tower of Hippicus.
Many and fierce were the sallies of the besieged, but as
often as they rushed on the well-disciplined foe, they
were driven back with considerable loss.  That night
both parties remained under arms, as the Romans every
moment expected a sudden attack, and the Jews feared
to leave their walls defenceless.
</p>

<p>
As soon as daylight returned the engagement was
renewed, and never was a contest maintained with
greater vigour and courage than were displayed on
either side.  The Jews strove to emulate one another
in their contempt of danger, and in the fearless exposure
of their lives, for they fought beneath the eye of Simon;
and such were the awe and reverence with which he had
inspired his followers, that they were willing to brave
every peril in the hope of obtaining his approbation.
Titus exercised the same influence over his troops,
and the pride of their first success, joined to his
continual presence, excited them to a stubborn and
unconquerable courage.
</p>

<p>
The central tower of the second wall was the point
against which the chief efforts of the Romans were
directed, and the dreaded Nico was brought to bear
upon it with all its resistless force.  This tower had
been committed by Simon to the care and defence of
Javan; and a strong garrison was placed under his
command for the protection of so important a post.  The
Romans soon drove away almost all these men by the
cloud of arrows which they sent among them from their
own movable buildings which they had brought to look
down upon them, and Javan remained with only ten
companions.  He scorned to fly, and determined to have
recourse to a stratagem by which an advantage might
be gained to his party.  He therefore desired his men
to remain quiet for some time, and conceal themselves
as much as possible from the enemy.  But when the
tower began to totter above their heads, he directed
them to start up and stretch forth their hands, as if
imploring mercy.  At the same time he advanced to
the battlements of the tower in a supplicating attitude,
and called loudly on the name of Titus.  His voice
reached the ears of the general, who immediately gave
orders for the assault to be suspended, and commanded
Javan to speak.  The artful Jew replied that it was his
sincere desire to surrender, and throw himself upon
the generosity of the noble Titus, and that he had
endeavoured to bring all those under his command
to the same determination.  As he made this deceitful
speech five of his men appeared to take his part, while
the rest declared that they would never be slaves to the
Romans, as long as death was in their power.  A fierce
quarrel seemed to follow these declarations, and the
assault was in the meantime entirely suspended.  Javan
observed this, and instantly sent one of his men secretly
to inform Simon of his artifice, and advise him to take
advantage of the temporary cessation of the siege, and
to concert measures for some vigorous sally, while he
endeavoured as long as possible to attract the attention
of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
He then continued his pretended expostulation with
the adverse party of his own men, who stood on the
breastworks, brandishing their swords with a menacing
air, and at length, as if resolved to die rather than yield,
struck their own breasts with violence, and fell, seemingly
dead.  The Romans were completely deceived by this
pretended act of devotion to liberty, and even pitied the
fate of the self-destroyed victims; but one of them, less
generous than the rest, discharged an arrow at Javan,
and wounded him in the face.  He withdrew the shaft
and held it reproachfully towards Titus, who sternly
rebuked the man who had shot it, and desired Josephus
to advance towards the tower and speak with the Jew.
He, however, knew his own countrymen too well to
place himself within their reach, and declined the errand,
but a deserter named Æneas offered to go in his stead.
Javan called to him to come close to the wall, that he
might throw down to him some money as a pledge of
his good faith; and when Æneas spread out the folds of
his cloak to receive it, he cast at him a large stone with
the intention of crushing him on the spot.  He missed
his aim, but wounded a soldier who stood near him, and
Titus then saw that the whole affair was a treacherous
device to gain time.  He was enraged at the deceit
which had been practised upon him, and gave instant
orders for the assault to be resumed with fresh vigour.
Javan perceived that no further advantage was to be
obtained, and in desperation he and his men set fire to
the tower in several places.  It blazed rapidly up around
them, and when the flames were high and fierce they
leaped boldly into the midst of them, and again deceived
the Romans into a belief that they had bravely sacrificed
their lives.  It was but another artifice, for they
had thrown themselves into a secret passage that led
underground to the interior of the city, where they soon
appeared, and boasted of their success in keeping the
enemy so long inactive.
</p>

<p>
On the fifth day from that on which Titus became
master of the first wall, the second also was taken, and
the Jews retreated.  The Roman general entered that
quarter of the lower city with a thousand men-at-arms
and a few other chosen troops, and found himself in the
midst of those streets occupied by the clothiers, the
wool-merchants, and the coppersmiths, with many narrow
lanes, leading to the walls in every direction.  In the
hope of gaining over the people to his side, and
convincing them that their wisest course would be to submit
without any farther struggle, Titus gave strict orders
that no houses should be set on fire or injured, and no
massacre committed.  He caused it to be proclaimed
that he did not wage war against the defenceless
population, but against the insurgent garrison; and that to
all the peaceable inhabitants he would readily restore
their property.  The leaders of the Jews and their
seditious troops regarded this lenity as a proof of weakness,
and threatened instant death to all who should attempt
to utter a word of surrendering.  They stabbed without
mercy every one whom they suspected of wishing for
peace, and then fell furiously on the enemy as they
passed along the streets.  Some poured their darts and
arrows upon them from the houses, and others rushed
upon them by the intricate and narrow lanes with which
they were well acquainted, but which embarrassed the
Romans greatly.  Others sallied out of the walls that
were already lost, by gates which were not yet guarded
by the conquering army, and attacked their enemy in
the rear.  Advance or retreat seemed alike difficult for
the Romans, and but for the presence of Titus, who came
in person to their relief with a band of archers, a
dreadful loss would probably have been sustained.  He,
however, succeeded in driving back the countless assailants on
every side, and brought off the greatest part of his men;
but the conquest which had been won with so much
labour and bloodshed was again lost, and the Jews
regained possession of the second wall.
</p>

<p>
This success inspired the insurgent troops with the
greatest joy and confidence, and they doubted not that if
ever the Romans again gained an entrance into the city
they should be able to repulse them as they had already
done; but they did not consider the progress of that
more certain enemy that already was working its silent
way through the city, and daily adding to the victims of
misery and violence.  The cruel and desperate soldiery
had hitherto lived in plenty on what they plundered from
the people, and they heeded not the distress which they
inflicted, and beneath which many were continually
sinking and expiring.  Indeed they rather rejoiced in
thus ridding the city of some part of its disaffected
populace, and continued to seize on all the provisions that
came in their way and retain them fur their own use.
They were unable to repair the breach which the Romans
had made in the wall, but with determined resolution
they presented themselves to fill it with their own bodies,
and for three days they fought without intermission.
Vast numbers fell on the spot, but their comrades slept
undauntedly upon their bleeding carcasses to supply their
place and share their fate.  On the fourth day they gave
way, and were compelled to abandon the post; when
Titus again took possession of the wall, and caused a
large part of it to be razed to the ground, while he
strongly garrisoned the remaining portion.
</p>

<p>
Still Antonia and the temple looked proudly down
upon the conquering arms of Rome, and all the high
places of Sion and David's city remained in their strength;
and the garrisons were undismayed at the loss they had
sustained.  Titus resolved to allow the besieged a little
time for reflection, in the hope that the peaceable party
might yet prevail before it should be too late, and
persuade the rebels to surrender.  In order to impress the
besieged still more with the strength and discipline of
his army, he employed the interval which he allowed
them from their exertions in taking a grand review of
all his troops within sight of the city.  From every
window and every tower that commanded a view of the
splendid pageant the Jewish people and their tyrant
defenders looked down with consternation and dismay,
while the whole Roman army, in their best equipments,
defiled beyond the wall.  It was a brilliant spectacle, for
all the arms were uncased, and the polished shields and
breastplates exposed uncovered to glitter in the
sunbeams; while the cavalry followed, leading their
beautiful and richly-caparisoned horses, whose trappings
gleamed with gold and silver.  All ranks, all classes of
persons, were assembled to look on their destined
destroyers; and truly it was a sight that might strike
terror into the boldest hearts, or induce any beleaguered
people to lay down their arms, except the obstinate
and insurgent Jews, who felt that they had too deeply
offended to hope for any terms from the Romans.
</p>

<p>
This beautiful but appalling spectacle was presented
to the eyes of the besieged for four days; but no offers of
capitulation were made&mdash;no overtures of peace reached
the Roman general; and with reluctance he gave orders
for the siege to be recommenced.  The first step was to
raise lofty mounds against the Antonia, and also against
that part of the wall which was defended by Simon.
The Jews had by this time learned to use their military
engines with great dexterity, and they now plied them
with deadly effect against the Romans employed in
constructing the works.  Titus was willing once more to
give them an offer of peace, and far this purpose he sent
Josephus again to address them; and having found a
spot where he could be heard without being exposed to
the arrows and darts of his countrymen, he made to
them a long and eloquent speech.  He used every
argument that religion or humanity could furnish.  Many of
the people were touched by his earnest expostulations;
but the Zealots were only the more irritated and enraged;
and their fury knew no bounds when they discovered
that numbers of the miserable populace were deserting
to the enemy.  Many sold all that they possessed in the
city, and then fled; others swallowed their money and
jewels, and then escaped to the Roman camp, where
they were kindly received, and suffered to pass
unmolested to whatever place they chose.  Their success
emboldened others, and all the efforts of John and Simon
were ineffectual to restrain the constant desertions that
now took place.  Their partizans watched every avenue
and outlet with the greatest care and diligence, and
cruelly slaughtered all whom they suspected of an intention
to desert.  This charge also served as a convenient
pretext on which they could seize and massacre any one
whose wealth they coveted, and numbers were put to
death who were innocent of any such design as that of
which the murderers accused them.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
</h3>

<p>
The son of Ananus no longer passed up and down the
streets of Jerusalem uttering his warning and prophetic
cry.  He was neither seen nor heard from the day that
the siege began.  The woes which he had so long and
so perseveringly denounced were come in all their dread
reality.  Famine, with its attendant miseries, was felt
throughout the city, and with the general distress the
desperation of the insurgents increased also.  There was
no longer any corn to be seen in the markets for sale,
and if the ruffian soldiers heard of any being concealed
in private houses, they furiously broke them open and
dragged away the treasure.  If they were disappointed
in the search, they tortured the wretched inhabitants
to make them disclose and deliver up what they
frequently did not possess.  Humanity shudders at the
horrid recital of the barbarity exercised by these
monsters, and the sufferings of their miserable victims;
which were aggravated by seeing their tyrants revelling
in plenty, and even in intemperance while they were
expiring for want.  Every natural affection, every
generous sentiment, was destroyed by the all-absorbing
hunger that raged among all classes.  The dearest and
the closest ties were severed, and those who would in
happier times have laid down their lives to preserve
those of their husbands, their wives, their children,
and other beloved relatives, now were seen to snatch
from their dying grasp the last morsel of food, and
greedily devour it before their eyes.  Oh these were
days of sorrow such as never had been, and may God
grant they never may be again!  The grey hairs of
old age, and the helpless innocence of childhood excited
no compassion&mdash;all were alike sacrificed to the cruel
selfishness that reigned triumphant in that abode of
crime and horror.
</p>

<p>
And were there no exceptions to this awful state of
sin and pollution?  Had the Lord God of Holiness
and mercy no sanctuary left in that once blessed city?
Blessed be His name, amidst so many who profaned
His dwelling-place, there were yet a few in whom His
image dwelt, and who thought upon his commandments
to do them.  In the house of Zadok, piety, charity,
faith, and resignation glowed with an inextinguishable
flame, and its inmates were as a burning and a shining
light in the midst of a thick darkness.  The influence
of Javan over the partizans of Simon was sufficient to
preserve his family from the visits of the plunderers, or
if a few of the ruffians attempted to enter the gates,
they found them too well secured and guarded; and
hitherto the effects of the famine had not been felt so
powerfully in that habitation as in almost every other.
Zadok had foreseen what must be the unavoidable
consequence of the waste and destruction of provisions
that had been committed by the members of every
faction before the commencement of the siege, and he
had taken the precaution to lay up large stores of corn
and other articles of food against the day of necessity.
These stores were unknown to the insurgents, or doubtless
even the protection of Simon himself would have
failed to save the dwelling from their attacks, or the
inhabitants from outrage and slaughter.  The provisions
thus preserved were not kept for the use of Zadok's
family, but were freely bestowed on those who had taken
refuge in his house, and on many others who knew his
benevolence and came secretly to share it.  He himself,
and all belonging to his establishment, allowed themselves
no more sustenance than was barely sufficient to support
life, that they might have more to give to those who
needed; and their wasted forms and pallid cheeks would
have prevented any suspicion that they yet possessed
the means of living in plenty.
</p>

<p>
The days, the weary days, passed on; and the provisions
in Zadok's secret storehouse rapidly diminished.
With great reluctance he was compelled to restrain his
liberal spirit, and refuse all further aid to those who
were not of his own household.  The strangers who had
so long found an asylum beneath his roof, went forth to
seek a subsistence elsewhere, but they only found death
in some of its most dreadful forms.  Naomi wept in
secret over the sufferings which she could no longer
relieve; but when she sat by the side of her mother,
or glided about, a shadow of her former self, to minister
to her wants, she forced an appearance of cheerfulness
which was far from her compassionate heart.  It was
with gratitude and joy she watched that beloved mother,
and saw her daily fading away; for though "the
outward man decayed, the inward man was renewed day
by day;" and she knew that death would be a kind and
welcome visitor, to take her from a scene of surpassing
woe, to the presence of her Saviour and her God.
Zadok too was resigned to part with the object of his
love, rather than see her linger in protracted sorrow and
anxiety; but grief would frequently unman his soul,
and tears would start to his gazing eye, while he looked
on the sinking form of her whom he loved with a devoted
affection, and who had been the light and the joy of
his life.
</p>

<p>
Many hours in every day he passed from home, in
fruitless efforts to lessen the misery that surrounded him,
and to pour the balm of religious consolation into the
bleeding hearts of his dying and despairing fellow-citizens;
and when, wearied with exertion and oppressed
with sorrow, he returned to his home, it was with
difficulty that he roused himself to speak cheeringly
to his dying wife, and his afflicted but uncomplaining
daughter.  Zadok knew that Naomi had no hopes of her
country being delivered from the Roman yoke; he
knew also that she looked for the accomplishment of
every word of those terrible predictions pronounced
on the city by Jesus of Nazareth; and he marvelled
greatly at the firmness and resignation with which she
supported these prospects of desolation.  But he did not
know the inward peace that pervaded her soul, in spite
of outward trials, and which was the result of her
unshaken confidence in Him whom Zadok despised.
He did not know that such a faith in a crucified
Redeemer as glowed in the breast of Naomi, could enable
a weaker mind than hers to triumph over all the ills that
flesh is heir to, or he would have ceased to wonder at
her cheerful patience, and at the smile with which she
strove to greet him on his return from his daily
occupations.  It was for the sufferings of others that Naomi
mourned, and for the spiritual darkness of her countrymen,
especially her dearly-loved father and erring brother:
for herself life had little charm, and death no terrors;
and her most earnest prayer was that the Lord might
see good to take her to himself shortly after her mother's
removal, and ere the city should be given up to the
outrages of a conquering army.  It was only when she
thought of Marcellus that a bursting sigh would rise,
and a bitter tear tremble in her eye.  It was sad to
think how soon that heart which was devoted only to
her would have to mourn her loss; and that eye which
had looked on her with admiring pride and love, would
seek her among the mangled bodies of the famished and
the slain.
</p>

<p>
Zadok lamented and deeply sympathised in the
miseries of his nation, but he did not yet despair of her
final triumph.  He could not yet believe that the God of
Israel had abandoned his favoured people, and the city
where his glory had dwelt; and though heavy were the
chastisements with which He was now visiting the sins
of his children, yet the priest trusted that He would
era long remove the rod of his anger, and stand up to
deliver them from the oppressor.  In this hope he
sustained his own dauntless courage, and excited others to
the same confidence.  Javan was even more sanguine
than his father: he exulted in the desperate condition
to which Jerusalem was reduced, for he hoped that
when the hour of her greatest darkness had arrived,
then would the "Sun of Righteousness arise, with
dealing in his wings;" then would the great Messiah
appear, to triumph over every foe, and reign "before
his ancients gloriously."
</p>

<p>
The rabbi Joazer also shared these hopes, and
frequently expressed them to Salome, when he came to
visit her, and sought to cheer her drooping spirits.  He
readily perceived that she did not enter into his
expectations of future victory, and he taunted Naomi with
having filled her mother's mind with her own heretical
fears.  Naomi did not deny the charge; she wished
that Salome would take courage to confess her faith ere
her weakness should become too great for the effort;
but when she gently urged her to do so, she always
replied that she had not then the power; and her
daughter feared that she would depart without making
one effort for her husband's conversion.  The fear of
death had ever been a powerful feeling with Salome;
and its near approach had not yet lessened its terrors.
Her hope of future blessedness was daily growing
stronger and clearer, but her dread of the dark valley
of the shadow of death, by which she must pass to her
glorious rest, appeared unconquerable, and was the
cause of much anxiety to Naomi.  Many and fervent
were the prayers she offered up at the throne of grace
for her mother's support and comfort when the trying
hour should arrive; and unweariedly did she endeavour
to strengthen her soul with the blessed promises of God,
that He will be with his people in the time of weakness,
and at the hour of death.
</p>

<p>
For a time her efforts would sometimes appear successful,
and Salome would recover the naturally placid
expression of her countenance, but ere long the same
doubts and distressing fears would arise and the same
restlessness return.  Then she would call on Naomi, and
entreat her again to repeat the same words of consolation,
and pour forth her prayers in her behalf.  If
Naomi was absent, her faith failed; but while she hung
over her, and whispered to her the encouraging promises
of Scripture, she felt calm and joyful.  She was sorely
tempted of Satan; but when she could wield the sword
of the Spirit, and shelter herself behind the shield of
faith, she was enabled to quench all his fiery darts, and
baffle his reiterated attacks.  There was one point
on which she was very anxious, and suffered many fears;
and that was whether she could be accepted by Christ
as one of his children, when she had not been admitted
by baptism into his visible church; and it required all
Naomi's arguments to convince her that as the appointed
rite was out of her power, a willing heart and obedient
spirit would be as acceptable to her merciful Lord, as if
she had enjoyed all the privileges and advantages of
partaking in his sacraments.  When the tempter was
baffled at one point he harassed her at another; but
"He who was on her side, was greater than all that
were against her;" and he gave to Naomi the happy
privilege of soothing her mother's fears and stilling her
doubts.  Her precious copy of the Gospel was now
doubly valuable to her, since she was permitted to read
it to her dying parent, and witness the peace and joy
which she derived from listening to it.  She grieved
that Salome still enjoined her to conceal it whenever
Zadok entered the house, or approached the terrace
where she loved to repose during the cool evening
hours; but she waited in faith and patience for the time
when her timidity should cease, and she should obtain
an answer to her prayers.  Her tender assiduity was
also engaged in daily efforts to save her mother from
bodily privations, and furnish her every indulgence and
comfort that her weakness required.  Little food of any
kind remained, and that was mostly of the coarsest
description; but Naomi could look from the terrace,
and behold her father's garden beyond the walls, where
the ripe fruit was hanging in clusters.  Could she not
obtain some to cool the parched lips, and allay the feverish
thirst of her mother?
</p>

<p>
She did not communicate her bold scheme to Salome,
for she knew that she would forbid her attempting it;
but she applied to the faithful and devoted Deborah,
and with some difficulty persuaded her to consent to
share the enterprise.  With trembling steps these two
defenceless women issued from the private gate at the
back of Zadok's house, and with many a fearful glance
on either side, passed rapidly down the unfrequented
lane that led to the wall of the city.  A sentinel was
posted at the narrow gate through which she had so
often passed in former days to bend her steps towards
Bethany, but he was one of her father's own retainers,
for the care of that entrance was committed by Simon
to the priest.  The man at first refused to let her pass,
but at length he was moved by her entreaties, and
unlocked the heavy portal, on her promise to return
with the greatest speed.  His life would have been
forfeited if his breach of orders had been discovered;
but he could not refuse the urgent request of his young
mistress; and that part of the town was then almost
deserted, as all the troops were engaged at the northern
wall, except a few sentinels who kept watch over the
movements of the tenth legion on the Mount of Olives.
The garden of Zadok was extensive, and part of it
reached almost to the foot of the wall which circumstance
had preserved it from the destruction that had fallen on
all the orchards and gardens at a greater distance.  The
troops also who were encamped on the opposite hill had
hitherto been employed in constructing their mounds
and intrenchments; and no attack had been made on
the eastern side of the city.  Naomi darted forward
with rapid footsteps, and in a few minutes she had
gathered as much fruit as her enfeebled hands could
carry.  Her heart beat violently with fear, but she
blessed God for the treasure she had obtained, and hastily
called on Him to protect her.  Followed by Deborah,
breathless with fear and speed, she regained the gate,
which was immediately opened by the sentinel, and as
speedily closed and secured.  She hoped that all danger
was past; but who can conceive her terror when she
saw a party of Simon's men appear, who, on perceiving
her, rushed towards the spot where she stood!  She
sprang forwards with her burden, in the hope of
reaching the entrance to her father's house, and Deborah
attempted to follow her; but their trembling feet were
unable to save them, aid the ruffians surrounded and seized
them.  Naomi sank on her knees, and while the prize
which she had encountered so much danger to obtain,
fell on the ground, she buried her face in the folds of
her garment, and implored the mercy of those wretches
who knew not what mercy meant.  At this moment
the voice of Javan sounded in her ears, and looking up,
she beheld her brother, who gazed upon her with
astonishment and displeasure.  He was leader of the
party who had thus intercepted her return, and he had
followed them more slowly when he saw them rush upon
their prey.  Little did he suspect that it was his sister
who was thus in the power of the savage crew, until
the sound of his voice caused her to raise her head, and
he beheld her pale and terrified countenance.  With a
stern authority he commanded his men to let her go
free, and they sullenly obeyed him; but it was with the
angry look of a beast of prey, compelled to relinquish
its intended victim at the word of its more cruel and
powerful master.
</p>

<p>
Javan then raised his sister, and demanded for what
cause she had ventured out, and where she had
procured the fruit which lay scattered around her.  He
was astonished at the boldness of her enterprise, when
she informed him that she had been to the garden
beyond the walls, and could not refuse his admiration
at the filial devotion which had prompted her to make
such a perilous attempt.  He conducted her to the
door of Zadok's house, closely followed by the terrified
Deborah, who, in spite of her alarm, had gathered up
the fallen fruit that was within her reach, and bore it
off amid the fierce glances of the soldiers.  They did not
dare to snatch it from her; but they muttered curses on
their leader, who had overawed their violence and
prevented their cruelty.  Javan had saved his sister from
the consequences of her temerity, but he determined
to execute prompt vengeance on the sentinel who had
permitted her to take so daring a step.  He returned
to his men, and seeing their looks of rage and
disappointment, he commanded them to allay their thirst for
blood by slaying the unfaithful sentinel.  In a moment
they transfixed him with their lances, and then threw
his bleeding corpse at the threshold of Zadok's house,
as a warning to his daughter that her excursions exposed
both herself and others to peril.  The ruffians then
opened the gate, and rushed tumultuously out in search
of those fruits which had tempted Naomi.  Javan did
not attempt to restrain them, for he feared to chafe their
angry spirits too much, and he suffered them to gratify
their love of destruction by breaking and cutting down
the luxuriant trees and plants, after they had gathered
the fruit.  Some they carried away, but much more they
trampled beneath their feet, and then returned again to
the gate.  Javan left two of the party to act as sentinels
in the place of him whom they had slain, and led on
the rest of the band to execute the business which
had called for their exertions, when their attention
had been diverted by the appearance of Naomi and her
attendant.
</p>

<p>
Salome had been carried out to her customary place
on the terrace, and was reclining there, when Naomi
returned to her, paler than ever, and greatly agitated,
but still with an expression of joy lighting up her
countenance.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you been, my child?" asked Salome
eagerly; "and why have you been so long absent?
Have you been to Mary's house, and brought from her
garden those beautiful grapes?"
</p>

<p>
"No, mother, Mary's garden has been long ago exhausted
of all that it produced.  These grapes I gathered
from the vines which last summer you trained over the
entrance to our own garden by the brook."
</p>

<p>
"What can you mean, Naomi!  Have you ventured
beyond the walls?  You could not have been so rash?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw your feverish cheek and parched lip, my
mother, and I saw these clustering grapes and ripe figs
hanging in our own beautiful garden.  Can you wonder
that I should make an effort to obtain them for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Bless thee, my dearest Naomi.  But the risk was too
great, and you must not venture again.  Did you meet
no one by the way?  I heard a noise of shouting and
violence in the street beneath the wall."
</p>

<p>
"It was a party of Javan's soldiers," replied Naomi.
"They did alarm me greatly; but the Lord preserved
me, and sent my brother to deliver me out of their
hands."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have indeed been exposed to danger, and
for my sake, Naomi.  Never, never again let your
anxiety for my comfort lead you to take such a step.
Rather would I bear the extremity of suffering and
want, than that you should encounter the risk of
meeting those lawless ruffians who are the scourge of our
unhappy city.  Promise me, my child, that you will not
again set your foot beyond these walls, which by God's
blessing have hitherto protected us from their violence."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not again be tempted by the fruitfulness of
that beloved spot yonder," answered Naomi with a sigh.
"Look, mother, the spoilers are there.  I see them
cutting down and wantonly destroying all the plants
and flowers, in which we used to take so much delight.
There, there they fall beneath the strokes of their swords,
and the fertile garden is becoming a desert."
</p>

<p>
Naomi turned away, unwilling any longer to witness
the havoc and destruction of the trees beneath whose
shade she had passed the happiest hours of her childhood
and youth.  Just then the little David came bounding
along the terrace towards her, and called away her
attention by his playful caresses.  He came for the
daily supply of food which Naomi denied to herself that
she might bestow it on him.  She could not bear to see
his little dimpled cheek grow pale and wan, and his
bright laughing eye look dim with pining want; and to
supply the deficiency of nourishment which his mother
was now unable to prevent, she every day laid by a
portion for her little favourite.
</p>

<p>
The house of Mary was at a very short distance from
that of Zadok, and when the street was empty, the little
boy used to come day by day for his accustomed meal.
How joyfully he smiled when Salome beckoned him to
the side of her couch, and placed in his hands a bunch
of grapes that they could hardly hold!  The little fellow
eagerly swallowed a few of the delicious fruit, and then
pausing, he exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
"I will take them to my mother; she said she was
very hungry, and her cheek looked very pale when I
kissed her and came away.  These grapes will do her
good."
</p>

<p>
"You shall take her some more, my dear boy," said
Salome: "I fear she suffers much distress and want
Would to God that I could relieve her."
</p>

<p>
The grateful happy child received the gift with joy,
and calling his nurse, hurried back to share the unusual
luxury with his mother.  Mary was indeed reduced to
a degree of privation and want, which her delicate and
luxurious mode of life had made her quite unequal
to bear with fortitude or patience.  Her temper was
naturally irritable and uncontrolled, and now anxiety,
and fear, and distress had made her still more the slave
of passion.  She sat gloomy and distracted in her
chamber, when her lovely boy ran towards her with
childish glee, and presented his welcome offering.  Mary
snatched the fruit and eat it hastily.  She did not look
pleased, as David had expected, but she gazed wildly at
him, and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you weep, mother?" asked the child.  "I
thought that you would smile and thank me, as I
thanked the good Salome."
</p>

<p>
"I weep because my heart is sad," replied Mary.
"The heiress of Bethezob is reduced to beggary, and
her child is fed by the charity of others.  O my father,
if thou hadst foreseen the sufferings of thy daughter, it
would have broken thy heart, which lived but in me,
and the hope of my happiness.  Alas! the spoiler has
taken all the wealth which thou didst bequeath to me.
My friends have forsaken me, my domestics despise and
rob me, and I am desolate and miserable."
</p>

<p>
It was too true.  Mary had lived in dissipation; and
those who gladly frequented her house when they found
splendour and profusion there, abandoned her when she
had no longer the means of entertaining them.  She
had neglected the friendship of Zadok and his family;
and though her child spent much of his time with them,
she had seldom crossed their threshold since she had
ceased to be an inmate of their house.  Now that she
was in distress, pride withheld her from seeking their
society; and though she received from them almost
all her means of subsistence, it was with a sullen and
ungracious spirit.  It was from the vengeance of Isaac,
and the treachery of her servant Reuben, that she had
suffered the loss of almost all her property.  She
confided blindly in the supposed integrity of Reuben, and
he knew where she had concealed the most valuable of
her possessions.  He failed not to inform his employer
Isaac of what was told to him in confidence, and ere
long a band of Zealots entered and pillaged the house.
It was a part of their orders to carry off the lady of
Bethezob to the head-quarters of their party in the
temple; but she succeeded in eluding their search, and
remained free, but deprived of all that might avail
to procure the necessaries of life as the scarcity and
famine increased.  A measure of wheat was now worth
far more than its weight in gold, and the vilest rubbish
was eagerly purchased at a high price by those who still
had money in their possession.  All the grass and herbs
that could be found in the city were used as food by
those who were destitute of any other means of
subsistence; and many of the poorest of the people would
steal out, and wander by night down the ravines, in the
hope of picking up something to allay the torments of
hunger.  These wretched creatures would willingly have
fled, and deserted to the Romans: but they hesitated to
forsake their wives and children, who were sure to be
cruelly murdered as soon as it was known that their
husbands and fathers had left the city.  Titus
discovered the practice of these men, and set an ambush
to surprise and take them prisoners.  When they were
attacked they made a vigorous resistance, but they were
overpowered and carried to the camp.
</p>

<p>
For the crime of defending themselves, they were
barbarously scourged and tortured, and then hung up
before the walls writhing in the agony of crucifixion.
Again and again others were driven by despair and
famine to make the same attempt at obtaining relief, and
the same dreadful fate awaited them.  When morning
dawned upon that ill-fated city, it often displayed to the
view of the horror-stricken inhabitants as many as five
hundred crosses, each supporting a tortured victim.  The
Roman soldiers added ridicule and insult to their cruelty,
and fastened the bodies in every sort of ludicrous position,
taunting and reviling the miserable beings while they
expired in agony.  The spots chosen for these appalling
scenes were at length crowded with crosses, and wood
was wanting to furnish fresh implements of torture for
the prisoners who were nightly brought in.  Nothing
can be said to extenuate the guilt and inhumanity of
these executions.  They were a fearful example of
heathen barbarity in the most civilized nation of that
period, and by the command of one of her most enlightened
generals.  Titus believed that by these awful and
repeated warnings he should weary the people of
resistance, and convince them that it was better to throw
themselves openly on his mercy; and he also feared
that it would be unsafe to let them escape.  In vain
Marcellus pleaded with his noble commander, and besought
him almost with tears of agony, to forbear this
wanton infliction of death and torment.  His
expostulations moved the general to sympathy, but failed to
make him change his cruel policy.
</p>

<p>
The effect produced on the besieged by these executions
was contrary to that which Titus expected.  The
Zealots seized on the friends and relatives of the victims
and dragging them to the walls and towers, compelled
them to behold the dreadful spectacle of Roman cruelty.
This checked the desertions; and none fled to the camp
of the besiegers but those who preferred running the
risk of immediate death rather than remaining to suffer
the slower torments of hunger.  Some of these were sent
back into the city by Titus with their hands cut off
and a message to John and Simon, exhorting them to
capitulate before it was too late, and not force him to
destroy both the city and the temple.
</p>

<p>
Instead of complying with this advice, John
commenced undermining the embankments on which the
Roman engines were placed.  He carried a quantity of
combustibles to the spot; and when all the machines
were erected and ready to begin their attack, he set fire
to the pitch and sulphur, and immediately the ground
began to rock and heave as with an earthquake.
Volumes of smoke and flame issued from the ground,
and the embankment, with all the ponderous engines,
fell into the fiery abyss.  Thus the works which had
cost the Romans seventeen days of constant labour were
destroyed in an hour.  The army were greatly discouraged
at this and other losses which were effected
by the desperate valour of the Jews.  Titus called a
council of his officers, and proposed to them that they
should either storm the city immediately, repair the
works and resume the siege, or else draw a complete
line of circumvallation round it, and starve the garrison
to surrender.  The last of these plans was decided on,
and immediately executed.  In three days the trench
and embankment were completed, and extended a
distance little less than five miles.
</p>

<p>
Naomi could watch the progress of this work along
the Valley of Kedron and the Mount of Olives, and with
the sad reality before her eyes she remembered how the
pitying Jesus had declared that "the days should come
when the enemies of Jerusalem should cast a trench
about her, and keep her in on every side;" and she
looked for the speedy accomplishment of the remaining
part of the denunciation, "and they shall lay thee even
with the dust, and thy children within thee, because
thou knowest not the time of thy visitation."
</p>

<p>
Salome had ceased to occupy her usual position on
the terrace.  Her weakness had greatly increased, and
she had received a shock to her feelings the last time she
had been carried out, which had almost overpowered
her.  She had desired to enjoy the early morning air,
and watch the sun rising gloriously over the Mount of
Olives, and she was borne as usual to her couch.  But
what was her horror on looking towards the mount, to
behold the summit crowned with crosses, and to perceive
that each cross was furnished with a living victim!
A deadly faintness overcame her, and she was carried
back to her chamber in a state of unconsciousness.
When she recovered, the impression of the dreadful
spectacle clung to her mind, and she could not shake it
off for several days.  Her weakness and exhaustion
were considerably augmented by the shock, and it was
evident to Naomi and her father that the beloved
sufferer had not long to live.
</p>

<p>
Naomi rejoiced to perceive that as her mother's bodily
powers failed, her soul was strengthened, and her desire
to bear a good testimony to the grace of her Redeemer
before she departed became fixed and strong.  The
dread of death subsided, and she looked for its approach
with calmness and peace.  Her only fear was now for
the fate of Naomi, and though she tried to put her trust
in the Lord, and commit her child to Him in confidence,
she could not think of leaving her in that distracted city
without grief and anxiety.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
</h3>

<p>
The immediate effect of the strict blockade which Titus
had established was to carry the horrors of famine to
their height.  Whole families lay expiring together,
and the streets were strewn with the bodies of the dead
and dying.  None wept over them&mdash;none buried them.
No cry was heard in the streets, for the wretches had
not strength to complain: they lay in a state of mute
anguish, waiting unheeded by those whom once they
loved, for the last expiring pang.  The only sounds
that broke the oppressive silence of that city of death,
were the bands of robbers forcing open the houses in
search of food and plunder, or the blows which they
wantonly inflicted on the dead bodies that were
scattered on every side.  For some time the soldiers made
an attempt at burying the corpses, as they feared their
exposure might occasion a pestilence; but they soon
became too numerous, and then they threw them over
the walls into the trenches below.  Even this precaution
ceased ere long, and the whole city was poisoned with
the odour as of a vast charnel-house.  The way to the
walls was actually choked with dead bodies; yet still
the soldiers both of John and Simon went trampling
over them to man the fortifications, with a desperate
courage and hardened indifference.
</p>

<p>
At this time another crime was added to the awful
catalogue of Zion's sins.  The high-priest Matthias was
slain on a pretended charge of holding a correspondence
with the Romans; and the cruelty of the act was
enhanced by the three sons of the venerable old man
being first massacred before his eyes.  This sacrilegious
murder at length excited in the populace a determined
resolution to shake off the tyrannical yoke under which
they had so long groaned in silence.  One of their
number, named Judas, conspired with several others to
betray one of the towers to the enemy.  They made the
offer of surrendering it, but the Romans had learned to
be suspicious of such overtures, and hesitated to take
advantage of it.  While they paused the conspiracy
was revealed to Simon, and instant vengeance overtook
Judas and his accomplices.  They were slaughtered,
and their bodies cast down to those with whom they
had been parleying.  This plan being defeated, the
wretched people again began to desert in multitudes;
but their sufferings did not always end with their reaching
the Roman camp, for many of the famished creatures so
eagerly devoured the food which was presented to them
by the soldiers that they died in agony.  Others perished
yet more miserably.  They were suspected of having
swallowed their gold and jewels before they left the
city; and to obtain this wealth the Arabian and Syrian
allies seized a large party of the deserters, and actually
cut them open alive, and searched for the treasure.
</p>

<p>
When this inhuman proceeding reached the ears of
Titus he was filled with indignation, and would have
ordered his cavalry to surround and slay the murderers,
but that their great numbers deterred him from such an
act of justice.  He however denounced death against
whoever should in future be guilty of such barbarity
but the love of gold was in many instances greater than
the fear of detection, and the crime was not entirely
prevented.
</p>

<p>
The calamities of Jerusalem were at their height.
What a spectacle of God's righteous vengeance did the
proud city now display!  Within the walls the rival
factions dyed their hands in each other's blood, and in
that of their helpless countrymen; and without, the
Roman camps covered the surrounding hills.  The
trumpets and shouts of the armed host resounded
through the day, and in the darkness of night their
watch-fires were seen gleaming on every side.  All the
pastoral beauty of the scene had departed.  The
summer dwellings and garden-houses of the Jewish nobles
that so lately were seen among the trees, in every
variety of architecture, had been levelled to the ground
by the troops of Titus, and the vineyards and shady
groves were swept away.  The gardens had become a
sandy waste, cut up in every direction by trenches and
military works, in the midst of which was seen the fatal
wall of Titus, effectually shutting out all hope of relief
or reinforcement from the beleaguered city.  Within
its sad enclosure all was dark despair.  The daily
sacrifice had ceased, for no victims remained to offer, and
the sword and famine had fearfully reduced the once
crowded population.  The dogs and vultures shared
their dreadful meal undisturbed, for none ventured into
the streets except they were compelled to do so; and
then they hurried on as swiftly as possible, to avoid the
spectacle of horror that surrounded them, and dreading
every moment that the hand of violence would lay them
by the side of the mangled corpses that strewed the
way, to become the food of birds and beasts of prey, or
the objects of insult to the yet more ferocious soldiery.
In every street numbers of houses which had been
partially destroyed by fire, were abandoned to decay, the
doors and windows torn away, and in many instances
the roofs fallen in, and the once splendid edifices left to
be beaten by the storm and become the habitations of
owls and bats.  From some of the shattered tenements
lights might be seen gleaming through the fissures in
the walls, and showing that they were yet peopled with
miserable human beings.
</p>

<p>
Among the desperate men who passed to and fro
through these desolate streets were many who even yet
retained that natural vividness of countenance for which
their nation ever were distinguished; but it was hardened
by ferocity, and the keen black eye scowled darkly,
while the compressed lip spoke of desperate thoughts
and the firmness of despair.  Then there were hurried
gatherings of these insurgents, frequently ending in
fierce quarrels and murders in the open face of day, or
in the sudden attack of some house that was yet deemed
worth pillaging.
</p>

<p>
Men and angels might have wept to behold how
deeply this city of God, this sanctuary of holiness, was
sunk into misery and desolation.  But oh! it was the
spiritual degradation of her children that called for the
deepest pity; it was the spectacle of human nature in
all its own depravity, unrestrained by the fear of God
or the laws of man; it was the scourge of the Almighty
lighting on this rebellious people, and piercing their
inmost souls&mdash;a faint representation of that eternal
punishment, where those who persist in rebellion will
suffer and blaspheme for ever, but repent not.
</p>

<p>
Amid all the crime and all the horror of that siege,
there was one event that seemed to surpass every other,
and even moved the hearts of those to whom murder
was a pastime.  Spies were employed by the officers
of both John and Simon's party, to bring them intelligence
of any provisions that they might discover in the
houses of the famishing people; and one day the artful
Reuben came hastily to the temple, and informed Isaac
that he had observed the smell of food being cooked in
the house of his former mistress.  He had long ago
deserted her, and only visited the house to commit fresh
acts of depredation, or lead others to add to her misery,
and take from her and her child the scanty pittance that
she was yet able to procure.  Isaac summoned a party
of his chosen companions in cruelty, and hurried off to
the dwelling of Mary, followed by the traitor Reuben.
The door was fastened inside, but it soon yielded to the
furious blows of the assailants, and they rushed on to the
apartment usually occupied by the heiress of Bethezob in
the days of her wealth and prosperity, and so well known
to Isaac.
</p>

<p>
It was bereft of all its sumptuous furniture and rich
ornaments; the repeated incursions of the robbers had
left nothing that was valuable or beautiful.  But she
who had so often presided in that very chamber, amid a
crowd of admiring guests, was there,&mdash;yet alas, how
changed!  Her graceful form reduced to a living
skeleton, her lovely features sunk and disfigured, and
all that had given a charm to her presence departed.
Her eyes burnt with an almost unearthly glare, and on
her cheek was a bright hectic spot, the token of fever
or delirium.
</p>

<p>
She sat upon the ground, and when Isaac entered,
her head was upon her knees, and her face concealed.
She had not heard or heeded the noise of his violent
entrance, and moved not until his footsteps on the
uncovered marble pavement roused her from her painful
reverie.  Then she looked wildly up, and starting on
her feet, exclaimed, in a hollow and hurried tone,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Isaac, my betrothed husband, are you come at
last to claim your bride?  I was fairer in those happy
days when you first saw me in my pride and my beauty.
But hunger and strange thoughts have worn sad ravages
upon the form you used to praise."
</p>

<p>
Isaac did not reply: the memory of other scenes came
over his mind, and even he was moved at the sight of
the wreck of mind and body before him.  Mary
continued in the same wandering strain,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You see my apartments are not decked for our
wedding, Isaac; the spoilers have taken away all my
goodly furniture.  But, Isaac," she added in a whisper,
while she laid her wasted hand upon his arm, "I have
a feast prepared&mdash;a wedding feast!  Do not tell your
comrades, for there is not enough for all.  I have eaten
and am satisfied, and I have reserved the rest for you.
See here!"
</p>

FAMINE AND MADNESS.
</p>

<p>
She drew him towards a couch at the end of the
room, and raised the corner of the hangings.  There he
beheld the mangled body of a little child which had been
roasted, and from which part of the flesh had been torn
and devoured.
</p>

<p>
The bloodthirsty, the cruel Isaac drew back with a cry
of horror, and a shudder passed through his powerful
frame, while the blood curdled in the veins of his
companions, who had followed closely, in the hope of
partaking in the expected meal.
</p>

<p>
"Why do ye tremble?" cried Mary, fiercely: "his
mother has eaten, and will not you?  Oh! do ye say
that I murdered him?  my beautiful, my beloved!  Did
ye see me give him that last embrace, and did ye behold
his sweet blue eyes as they smiled at me through their
tears?  I held him to my bursting heart, but the
demon within me strangled him&mdash;it was not I that
did it.  Oh do not look so loathingly at me&mdash;it was the
fiend that has so long possessed my soul.  It was famine,
Isaac, that drove me to it.  It was better that his
mother's hands should take away his life, than that her
eyes should see him pine away and die for want!"
</p>

<p>
"Let me go, unnatural monster in a human form!"
cried Isaac, bursting from her grasp; for she held his
arm with the strength of a maniac, and fixed her fiery
eyes upon him with a gaze that made his blood run
cold.  "Let me go, ere I plunge this dagger to thy
heart."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that would be the kindest deed that you could
do for me," answered the wretched mother; "God and
man have deserted me, and devils possess my soul.
Here, give the fatal stroke, and end the miseries that
I have no power to endure."
</p>

<p>
She sank at his feet, exhausted with her wild emotions
and the effort she had made.  Her eye was fixed on
him, as he retreated slowly from that once radiant and
joyous being, who now lay crushed beneath a load of
misery and guilt.  Ere he reached the door he turned
again, and saw that the fire of that eye had fled, and the
features were fixed in death.
</p>

<p>
Isaac and his fierce companions retraced their steps
to the temple, and though they stepped unheedingly over
many a livid corpse that lay in their path, yet they
could not recall the dying look of the lonely heiress of
Bethezob without a shudder.  But the impression soon
died away, and they again busily engaged in the strife
and violence and ruthless war that filled the city.
</p>

<p>
For two days the scanty portion of food that Naomi
was able to procure and reserve for her little favourite
remained untouched; David did not appear, and she
became very uneasy.  She could not go out to seek
him, for her father had strictly prohibited her from
venturing beyond the gates of the house; and the
alarm she had experienced on the day she went to the
garden made her dread to expose herself to a similar
danger.  She waited anxiously until Zadok came home
on the second evening, and then besought him to go to
Mary's dwelling with some of his attendants, and
ascertain whether she and her child yet lived, or whether
either want or violence had put a period to their
existence.  Zadok was evidently distressed at her
inquiries, and at length told her that they had both
expired: but his manner bespoke something more than
his words declared, and Naomi entreated him to inform
her of all that he knew of the wayward Mary and her
lovely little boy.  Her father had heard the dreadful
story of their death, for it had spread through the city,
and caused a thrill of horror in every one who heard it;
but he wished to avoid shocking the ears of his daughter
with such a revolting account.  Her inquiries however
were so urgent, that he was compelled to own to her
that David had expired by the hands of his mother, and
that despair and misery had then speedily terminated
her existence.  More than that he did not disclose to
her; but that was sufficient to fill her with grief and
horror.  She could not but weep at the sad fate of the
engaging child in whom she had taken so much delight;
and still more at the thought of the frantic state of
misery to which his mother must have been reduced ere
she could have committed so dreadful a deed.  An
asylum had been offered to Mary in the house of Zadok,
when distress had first begun to be felt in the city; and
though she had then rejected it with some contempt,
and preferred trusting to her own resources, the offer
had been renewed more than once.  But Mary was too
proud to accept it; she knew that her whole mode of
life had ever been opposed to the purity and simplicity
that marked the family of Zadok; and in the presence
of Salome and her daughter she felt a restraint that was
extremely irksome to her spirit.  Her mind was weakened
by suffering and constant privation; and she sat in her
desolate house, brooding over her sorrows and fears until
reason forsook her, and she was left a prey to passion
and despair&mdash;an awful example of the depth of
depravity to which the human mind may sink when
unsupported by God's preventing grace, and a dreadful
fulfilment of the worst of those woes that had been
pronounced by the prophets of old on the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Salome's feeble remains of strength were daily
declining, and she blessed the Lord who was so mercifully
removing her from scenes of horror that harrowed her
soul.  The miserable death of her relative Mary and
the little David preyed upon her mind, and she passed a
restless night.  Zadok and Naomi had not retired to
rest, though it was past midnight, when they were all
startled by a tremendous crash which appeared to come
from the wall beyond the temple, where the greatest
part of the Roman army was posted, and where they
had just completed another set of military engines to
replace those which had been destroyed by the bold
stratagem of John.  They listened in breathless anxiety,
and expected every moment to hear the shouts of the
Romans and the sounds of a desperate conflict.  But
nothing reached their ears until the day dawned, when
Zadok hastened to discover the cause of their alarm.
The noise had been occasioned, as he feared, by a large
portion of the wall having fallen.  It had been shaken
by the blows of the engines during the preceding day,
and the subterranean passage which John had dug to
undermine the works of the enemy passed beneath that
spot.  It sunk, and the massy wall fell, leaving a heap
of ruins.
</p>

<p>
The Romans rushed to the breach as soon as daybreak
enabled them to perceive it; but they were
disappointed in their hopes of an immediate entrance, by
finding that John had, with great foresight, caused a
second wall to be built within, as a precaution against
the event which had just occurred.  This new erection
was, however, of no great strength, and Titus exhorted
his men to make a vigorous effort to scale it.  A Syrian,
named Sabinus, volunteered to attempt the perilous
enterprise, and eleven others followed his example.
With their shields held over their heads, they pressed
forward in spite of the shower of darts, and arrows, and
stones that were hurled upon them from above.  Sabinus
had actually reached the summit of the wall when
his foot slipped, and he fell on the inside.  Instantly he
was surrounded, and though he rose to his knees, and
made a valiant defence, he was soon overpowered and
slain.  Three of his followers were also killed by stones,
and the remainder carried back, all severely wounded, to
the camp.
</p>

<p>
But the Romans were not discouraged.  Two nights
after the falling of the wall, Marcellus resolved to make
a second effort to scale the breach and wall.  His heart
was wrung with agony at the protracted sufferings of the
wretched Jews, and it died within him when he thought
what might already have been the fate of Naomi.  The
only chance which seemed to remain of rescuing her, or
any of her countrymen, from destruction, was for the
besiegers to gain an entrance into the city ere famine
and strife had completed the work of death that was
going on within the walls.  Twenty of the soldiers of
the guard consented to follow him, with a standard-bearer
and a trumpeter.  He was also accompanied
by his valiant father, who gloried in his son's intrepidity,
and insisted on sharing the enterprise.  Soon after
midnight they passed silently through the ruins and reached
the wall.  They mounted it undiscovered by the guard,
who had fallen asleep overpowered with fatigue.  They
were instantly slain, and then Marcellus commanded
the trumpeter to sound a loud and stirring blast from
the wall which was already gained.  The sound aroused
the other sentinels, and those appointed to guard the
wall.  They saw that the enemy had surprised them,
but they knew not that the party was so small, and in
a momentary panic they fled.
</p>

<p>
Titus also heard the victorious sound of the trumpet,
and the shout of the triumphant band.  He hastily
summoned his officers and a strong party of soldiers,
and hurried to the wall, where by the light of torches
he saw his gallant young friend and his veteran father
standing on the wall, where they had planted the
standard of Rome.  Marcellus informed him that the
Jews had fled, and Titus with his troops succeeded in
surmounting the wall and scaling the tower of Antonia
before the affrighted Jews made any attempt to oppose
them.  They fled to the temple when they saw the
enemy entering the tower, while numbers of the Romans
gained access to the street below, by means of the
opening into the subterranean passages that had been
made by John underneath the wall, the entrance to
which was now abandoned by the besieged.
</p>

<p>
The Romans passed through the deserted Antonia,
and made a furious attack on the temple; but here they
met with a determined resistance from the followers of
John, while Simon's party hastened to join them, and
both factions united in their efforts to repulse the enemy
and drive them back to the tower.  Neither party
gained any great advantage with their swords and
spears, but at length the Jews came out and met their
assailants sword in hand.  Then the narrow passages
were soon crowded with the dead and wounded, and
the soldiers climbed over heaps of bodies to rush upon
their antagonists.  Ten hours did this deadly conflict
last; when Titus finding it was impossible to force his
way into the temple, withdrew his men, well satisfied
with having gained possession of the fortress of Antonia.
He loaded Marcellus with grateful praises for his gallant
and most successful enterprise, and desired him to name
his own reward, when the young Roman immediately
demanded that when the city was taken, Zadok and
his family should be spared; and requested Titus to
give strict orders throughout the army that his house
should be respected and left in undisturbed security,
until the inhabitants could be removed to a place of
safety.
</p>

<p>
Titus readily acceded to this request, and the situation
of the priest's dwelling was carefully described to the
troops, who were commanded not to enter it on pain of
instant death.
</p>

<p>
It was early in the month of July when the Antonia
was taken.  Titus gave orders that the magnificent
tower should be razed to the ground, and an easy ascent
made for his whole army to march up the hill on which
it was built.  He then resolved to make one more
attempt at persuading the obstinate insurgents to
surrender or to meet him in open battle, by appealing to
their religious feelings, which he believed yet to exist
in undiminished force.  He knew that it was a day
appointed in the Jewish law for a great sacrifice; but
no victims remained to be offered, and the people feared
to enter the temple.  He therefore sent Josephus to
speak with John, and offer him a free egress from the
sacred edifice, if he would come forth and fight, and
thus save the temple from pollution.  Josephus having
placed himself in a secure situation, delivered the message
to John, and further besought him to spare his country,
and not to cause the most holy sanctuary to be destroyed
by fire, which the Romans were ready to apply to it.
Some of the Jews were moved by his address, which
John perceiving, immediately replied to him with many
insulting words: and told him that he never entertained
the slightest fear of the temple being injured, as it was
the dwelling-place of Jehovah, and He would protect
it.  He then cursed the renegade Jew for his cowardice
and treachery, and while Josephus with tears and sobs
endeavoured to make an impression on his countrymen,
John sent out a party of men to seize upon him, and
bring him into the temple.  In this he was, however
disappointed, for Josephus escaped, and rejoined the
Romans in safety.
</p>

<p>
When Titus saw that he could neither persuade the
Jews to take pity on themselves and their families, nor
to regard the sanctity of the temple, he was compelled
against his will to resume the siege.  He resolved on an
attack in the darkness of night; and finding the place
too narrow for his whole army to act together, he selected
thirty men from each century, and informed them that
Cerealis should take the command, while he would
overlook them from one of the towers of Antonia that yet
remained uninjured.  His presence always acted as a
powerful stimulus to the bravery of his soldiers, and he
would have led them himself to the attack had not his
officers entreated him to refrain from such an exposure
of his person.  For their sakes he gave up the command
to Cerealis; but he proclaimed that his eye would
be upon the combatants, and that he should reward
every act of individual courage.  Led on by the hope
of earning their general's approbation, the troops
advanced to the temple walls at the ninth hour of the
night.  They did not, however, find the sentinels again
sunk in sleep as they had expected, but the garrison
were all on the alert, and ready to repel their attack,
They rushed out in large bodies, and the Romans
sustained the shock unmoved.  Those who followed in the
obscurity of the night mistook their own comrades for
the enemy, and multitudes of the Jews fell by the swords
of their own fellow-soldiers.  When day dawned on
the bloody scene, the fight was carried on with greater
equality, and was maintained for eight hours.  The
Romans fought for honour and promotion, and every
man strove to distinguish himself above his comrades,
and merit the reward promised by the general; but not
a foot of ground was gained; and at length the combatants
on each side, weary of such continued and fruitless
exertions, gave up the contest, and retired to their
respective quarters.
</p>

<p>
A considerable part of the Antonia was levelled, and
in seven days the Romans had constructed a broad road
up the steep ascent, and fortified it strongly on each
side.  When they had thus cleared the way to the
temple wall, they began to raise mounds; and notwithstanding
the great difficulty of procuring timber, and
the constant annoyance to which they were exposed
from the attacks of the Jews, they succeeded in erecting
embankments against four different parts of the outer
court.
</p>

<p>
Day by day the destruction was carried on, while the
horror-stricken inhabitants of Jerusalem trembled at the
progress of the foe.  Many still cherished a vain
confidence that the holy temple would never be suffered to
fall into the hands of the heathen, but that the Lord
of Hosts would yet manifest His power and save the
sacred edifice from ruin.  Among these Zadok was the
most sanguine, and he and Javan still cheered their
companions with words of hope and encouragement.
They both passed their time within the temple walls,
giving all their aid in its defence, while the daily
combats were carried on.  At night Zadok always returned
to his home, and saddened the sinking hearts of his
wife and daughter and the terrified Deborah with the
account of the operations of the enemy and the slaughter
of their own defenders.  They anticipated the evils
which he believed would never be realized; and amid
his many feelings of grief at the evidently approaching
death of his wife, one of the strongest was a deep regret
that she should be taken away before the glorious
appearance of Messiah, and not share with him in all the
triumph and prosperity of the promised kingdom.  Once
he expressed this regret to Salome, who regarded him
with an earnest expression of sorrow, while he spoke
with ardour of the blessed days that were yet reserved
for Zion.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Zadok," she replied, "talk not to me of our
country's prosperity.  Alas! that is yet far distant, and
we can hope to see nothing but her woe, even though
our days should be prolonged beyond the time allotted
to man.  I am about to leave you, my beloved Zadok,
and all my hopes are fixed on the joys of a better world
than this.  I know that you will deeply grieve at my
departure, and I could not think of our separation with
calmness, were it not for the confiding hope I feel, that
ere long you will join me where we shall never part
again."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot bid you banish these sad thoughts, my
Salome," replied her husband, with much emotion, "for
I cannot shut my eyes to the dreadful certainty that I
shall soon be left alone.  May all your future hopes be
realized, and may our souls dwell together in the
presence of God.  Yet I could have desired a longer
continuance of our union on earth, that you with me
might have beheld the Messiah coming in the clouds of
heaven to redeem Israel, and to sit upon the throne of
David in the glory of Jehovah."
</p>

<p>
"Zadok, I have learnt to know that Messiah will not
appear in glory until he stands in the latter day upon
the earth.  This is the time of Israel's darkness and
dispersion, so clearly foretold by all our holy prophets,
and her restitution is yet a long way off."
</p>

<p>
"Who has taught you to adopt this belief, Salome?
I fear that Naomi's wild fancies and expectations have
tinged your mind also.  You were wont to enter into
all the views which I, in common with our most learned
men, entertain of the coming of Messiah.  Our sacred
Scriptures plainly declare that it will be as we expect.
The time is already past when our nation began to look
for his appearing, and though it has been so long
delayed, we have evident tokens that we shall not now
look for him in vain.  Our land is trodden by strangers,
and our people are sunk in the lowest misery.  Now&mdash;now
is the time for the archangel's trump to rend the
sky, and proclaim to our trembling foes that He who
reigns on high is coming to protect his chosen people
from their insolent oppressions!  Salome, I look for him
each day: and at night while I am watching your
broken and uneasy slumbers, I listen for the piercing
sound, and look out through the dark sky to catch the
first beams of that great light that shall tell of his
coming.  This supports me through the scenes of horror
that I daily witness, and this enables me to mark
unmoved the progress of our foes.  I know that their
course will suddenly and swiftly be arrested when our
guilty city has received its measure of chastisement."
</p>

<p>
"Oh that these glorious but vain expectations would
vanish from your mind, Zadok!  I would to God that
your eyes were opened to the real state and future
prospects of our race!  Guilty indeed we are.  A load of
guilt rests upon the seed of Abraham that may not be
so quickly expiated.  O Zadok!  I tremble while I speak,
but I must declare the truth.  I know that nothing
but the blood of Christ can atone for the guilt of the
land where that blood was shed, and the blind people
who cried, 'His blood be on us and on our children!'"
</p>

<p>
"Salome!" cried Zadok, starting in surprise and
horror; "can I have heard aright?  What mean you?"
</p>

<p>
"Do not look so terribly at me, my own Zadok,"
replied Salome, in a faltering voice.  "Do not curse
your dying wife, though she confesses to you that all
her hopes of immortality are founded on the merits and
death of Jesus of Nazareth.  In his atoning blood I
trust for the pardon of my sins, and into his hands I am
ready to commit my spirit, for he has redeemed me."
</p>

<p>
"And do I live to hear this declaration from the wife
of my bosom?" exclaimed Zadok vehemently.  "O God
of my fathers, the measure of my sorrow is now full.
Salome, Salome, this from you!&mdash;you who have walked
through the path of life by my side, and never till this
hour have caused me one pang of disappointment.  I
believed that the unsullied faith of Abraham was your
support in these your last days on earth, and that when
I should depart in the same faith we should meet in
Abraham's bosom.  Now what is my hope?  You have
forsaken the Lord to worship a human being, and
removed your trust from the Ancient of Days to place it
on a crucified malefactor!"
</p>

<p>
Salome trembled violently.  She had expected that
Zadok would be greatly distressed at the confession of
her belief in Jesus, and therefore she had deferred it
from day to day; but she had not anticipated such a
burst of grief, and it almost robbed her of all courage
to proceed.  She looked at the agitated countenance of
her husband, and inwardly prayed for strength to support
her in this trying moment.  The prayer was heard, and
her sinking heart was stayed and encouraged.  She laid
her slender wasted hand on that of Zadok, and while she
grasped it with all the force that remained to her as if
she feared that he would leave her in anger, she again
addressed him.
</p>

<p>
"Zadok, I have loved you with a deep devoted affection
that your unutterable kindness has well merited and
well repaid.  It has been the object of my life to please
you&mdash;alas!  I fear I have often thought of pleasing you
more than the Lord my God.  Can you then believe
that I have lightly adopted opinions in opposition to
yours, and which I knew would give you displeasure and
grief?  I have long struggled against the convictions
that entered my mind many many months ago; but the
Lord was too strong for me.  He would not let me go
on in error and unbelief, but gradually He has dispersed
the clouds of prejudice that hung over my soul, and has
disclosed to me the way of salvation through his Son
Jesus Christ.  I could not shut my eyes to the dazzling
light of the Gospel, when revealed to me by the Spirit
of God.  As easily might I look up into the unclouded
noonday sky and not see the sun shining in his strength,
as read and hear the history of Jesus, and not perceive
him to be the Son of God, the promised seed of David."
</p>

<p>
Zadok did not reply.  He feared to give utterance to
his feelings, and suffered Salome to continue.
</p>

<p>
"It was the word of God, written by His servants, and
left for the conviction and comfort of His children in all
ages, that has wrought this change in my mind.  And
now, Zadok, listen to my request; it is the last that I
may ever have to make to you&mdash;let it not be the first
that you have ever denied me.  In the name of our
covenant God I entreat you to read the Gospel&mdash;to
listen to all that our dear Naomi has repeated to me;
and, above all, to pray that the Lord will graciously
enlighten your mind to understand and receive the truth.
Then I know that you will believe&mdash;I know that you
will see in Jesus of Nazareth the promised Messiah, who
was to grow up as a tender plant, and a root out of a
dry ground.  Did not the prophet rightly describe him
as despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief?  Zadok, you know the words of
Isaiah; and can you read them without feeling how
wonderfully they foretell the sufferings and death of
Jesus?  Oh, if you would but believe that he was
wounded for your transgressions and bruised for your
iniquities, you would find rest to your soul, and be filled
with such joy and peace, and such humble adoring
gratitude, as no other belief could ever inspire.  Promise
me, my own beloved husband&mdash;promise me that you
will comply with my request.  I am too feeble to speak
as I would fain speak to you."
</p>

<p>
Zadok was moved at her earnestness, and astonished
at the boldness and energy that seemed to animate her
timid sinking spirit.
</p>

<p>
"What is there," he cried, "in this new doctrine,
which thus seizes on its votaries with such infatuation?
Naomi was ever a wayward, enthusiastic girl, and I
might have anticipated that she would readily embrace
any visionary ideas that were presented to her.  But you,
Salome, I thought possessed a calmer spirit.  Why did
you not apply to me when first these doubts began to
trouble you?  I would have answered them, and restored
you to your former stability and faith in our holy religion."
</p>

<p>
"I feared your anger, Zadok, for I knew how strongly
you were opposed to the doctrines of the gospel.  But I
consulted the law and the prophets, I examined the
Scriptures with fervent prayer,  and I saw that they all
spoke of a suffering Messiah.  The descriptions of his
lowliness and rejection, his agonies and death, are as
full and as minute as any of those passages that foretell
his future glory and triumphant reign.  Both are the
inspired word of God, and both must be accomplished.
Jesus has suffered, and died, and ascended alive to
Heaven, thus fulfilling all that was declared of his first
coming.  Christ will hereafter come again in like manner
as he went up to Heaven, with the holy angels, and in the
glory of his Father.  Then shall he sit on his everlasting
throne, and then shall be the day of Israel's triumph.
They shall look on him whom they have pierced, and
mourn because of him, and he will remember his holy
covenant with them, and make them once more his own
people.  Zadok, let us believe in him now, that when
he comes, we may also be in the number of his saints,
And reign with him for ever.  Will you not believe in
his name, that name of power and love that can charm
away the fears even of a timid heart like mine?"
</p>

<p>
"Salome, I must leave you," replied Zadok gently.
"You are too weak for such a discussion as this, and I
see that just now all arguments would be ineffectual.  I
lament the change that has been wrought in you, but I
cannot look on your dear pallid face and feel an emotion
of anger.  The Lord has permitted this trial to come
upon me, and I will try to bear it with composure, and
not embitter your last hours by my unavailing regrets
that I have been compelled to leave you so much alone
with Naomi, and exposed to the influence of her erroneous
opinions.  May God bless you, and may he bring you
back to the right way before it is too late.  Oh, if your
name should be wiped away from the book of life!&mdash;but
it cannot be.  Your past life of obedience and piety will
be remembered, and the Lord will pardon the errors into
which you have fallen through weakness."
</p>

<p>
"Do not go thus sadly, Zadok; listen to me once more,
and give me the promise I so fondly ask, that you will
seek the truth.  O how I have prayed for you!&mdash;and I
feel as if my prayers would yet be heard.  My God has
softened your heart towards me, and you do not look at
me in wrath and hatred; surely he will do more, he will
give you grace to believe his word.  Will you read it?"
</p>

<p>
"I will, Salome.  I will read what you call the word
of revelation, but which I regard as a tale of imposture.
I know that Naomi possesses a copy; and had I ever
imagined it would work such ruin in your faith, I would
long ago have destroyed it.  Since you have read it, and
been deceived by it, I will also peruse it attentively&mdash;not
to believe its contents, but that I may be better able
to remove the errors which it inculcates."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, my Zadok!  Only read it, and your
acute judgment will quickly discern its divine truth.
You leave me happier far than I have been for months
past, for now I have told you the feelings of my inmost
soul, and I have a ray of hope that they may yet be
shared by you."
</p>

<p>
Zadok left the room, and immediately sought his
daughter in her own chamber.  She was engaged in
studying the contents of her highly-valued manuscript
when her father entered the room, and she laid it down
with a look of anxious fear.  What was her joy when
Zadok informed her of the confession which he had just
heard from her mother, and the promise he had given
her that he would read the book which had produced so
powerful an impression upon her mind!  Though this was
followed by a severe reproof for the part which Naomi
had had in her mother's conversion, and a strong
representation of the sorrow which she had thus occasioned
to her father, yet she could not conceal her gratitude and
delight at what had occurred.  She very meekly asked
the forgiveness of Zadok for having in this one instance
disobeyed him, and acted contrary to his wishes; but
she ventured at the same time to speak of her imperative
duty to point out the way of life to others, and especially
to one so near and dear to her, and not to neglect the
opportunity which had been afforded her of leading
her beloved mother to embrace those doctrines which
had brought light and joy and peace to her own soul.
</p>

<p>
Zadok was not angry at her boldness, nor did he
charge her to refrain from any further conversation with
her mother on the subject of their religion.  He saw
that the faith of both was unalterably fixed, and his was
not a heart that could take pleasure in harsh or oppressive
measures, when no good result could be hoped from
them.  He took the roll of parchment, and Naomi
blessed the Lord when she saw him place it in the folds
of his robe, and leave the room.  She hastened to
Salome's apartment to rejoice with her in the happy
result of her long-dreaded declaration, and to pray that
the Holy Spirit would bless to her father's soul the
perusal of the sacred volume.

CHAPTER XXV
</h3>

<p>
The Romans were securely established in the fortress of
Antonia, and they occupied the whole area between the
tower and the temple.  A magnificent portico united
the two buildings, and formed a means of communication
which the Jews were resolved to cut off before it
should be turned to their disadvantage by the besiegers.
They therefore contrived to set fire to the cloister, and
by this means made a breach which extended nearly
thirty feet.  The Romans in their turn set fire to the
remainder, and in a short time the whole of the
beautiful portico was a heap of smouldering ruins, and the
space between the temple and Antonia was entirely
cleared.  The Jews looked on from their walls, and
calmly allowed the flames to spread along the cedar roofs
and gilded mouldings, until they reached the battlements
of the temple.  That sacred edifice was yet uninjured;
and still they madly hoped to preserve it from
the hands of the heathen, who daily advanced upon
them by slow degrees, and made fresh steps towards
their final destruction.  The great cloisters that ran
along the inside of the western wall appeared to be the
portion of the temple that was most exposed to the
attacks of the enemy, and John was resolved that if the
Romans succeeded in getting upon the roof and attempting
to destroy it, their temerity should not go
unpunished.  He caused all the hollow space between the
beams and the roof to be filled with dry wood, pitch,
and other combustibles: and then he commanded his
men to withdraw, as if exhausted with fatigue.  The
Romans saw them retire, and many of the more wary
suspected that it was merely a stratagem to draw them
on to destruction.  But numbers were deceived, and in
spite of the warnings of their comrades, rushed
impetuously forward.  They applied the scaling-ladders
to the wall, mounted to the summit, and immediately
descended on the roof of the portico.
</p>

<p>
John saw that his artifice had succeeded; and when
the roof was covered with hundreds of the assailants,
and they were about to precipitate themselves into the
court below, he gave the word, and fire was applied to
the combustibles in several places at the same moment.
The flames burst forth with violence, and the Romans
found themselves surrounded with the roaring element,
and no way left of escape.  Filled with despair, many
of them leaped from the wall into the city, and were
dashed to pieces.  Others flung themselves down among
the enemy, who now crowded to the spot, and were
either crushed to death in the fall, or lay with broken
limbs in the midst of their enraged foes, and were
quickly slain by their swords and lances.  Many of
those who remained on the blazing roof were burnt to
death, while they looked vainly down towards their
fellow-soldiers in the area beyond the cloisters, who
were unable to afford them any assistance.  Titus
himself beheld their desperate situation, and deeply
commiserated it, though they had acted without orders,
and were suffering the consequences of their heedless
impetuosity.  He made every possible exertion to
rescue his brave men from a dreadful death, but without
success; and in profound sorrow he was forced to
behold even those who had retired to a broad part of
the roof and defended themselves valiantly, fall sword in
hand, and perish to a man.

The destruction of the cloisters had left the besiegers
in undisturbed possession of the outer court, or court of
the Gentiles.  The legionaries completed the erection
of their mounds on the eighth of August, and Titus
commanded the battering-rams to be planted against
the north gallery of the temple.  For the six preceding
days, the most powerful of all the military engines had
been playing upon the outer wall without intermission;
but the enormous size of the stones, and excellent
construction of the wall, had resisted all efforts at its
demolition.  A portion of the troops were at the same time
employed in undermining the northern gate, but in this
attempt they could make no progress; and nothing
remained but to apply the ladders and storm the
cloisters.  They met with no resistance in mounting to the
platform at the summit of the wall; but the moment
they reached it, the Jews hurled them violently down,
or slew them before they had time to cover themselves
with their shields.  In many places the ladders were
overturned when crowded with men, and they fell
backward on the marble pavement, and were dashed to
pieces.  The crash of the falling armour, the groans of
the wounded and dying, and the shouts of the
combatants, were mingled wildly and fearfully together;
while above all these sounds, the regular and uninterrupted
strokes of the engines were heard to fall on the
walls and buttresses with an overpowering and
thundering shock.
</p>

<p>
Many distinguished soldiers fell among the Romans
in this assault, and the Jews also lost several of their
bravest men; but they succeeded in repulsing the
enemy from the top of the wall, and considered themselves
victorious: they therefore sought a brief repose
after the toils of the conflict, and hoped for greater
success on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
This had been a day of awful suffering to poor Naomi.
When she repaired early in the morning to her mother's
chamber, she thought she perceived an evident alteration
in her countenance; and Deborah also confirmed
her in the belief that Salome had not many days,
perhaps not many hours to live.  Zadok lingered near
her, for he felt that he had not long to enjoy her
much-beloved presence; and it was with an agonizing effort
that he tore himself away, when Javan sent hastily to
summon him to the temple.  He felt it his duty to
repair to the holy place when he heard that the walls
were being stormed, and every arm was called for that
could be lifted in its defence.  Sadly he took leave of
his dying wife, who smiled sweetly at him, and
whispered a blessing as he kissed her marble brow.  He
dreaded that it might be the last smile he should ever
see on that loved countenance; but he charged Naomi
to send one of the domestics who were left to guard the
house, with all speed to the temple, if any further
change should take place, that he might hasten home
and receive her parting breath.
</p>

<p>
All day the fearful sounds of the assault struck
mournfully on the ears of Salome and her afflicted
attendants, mingled with the shriller blast of the trumpets,
and the cries of agony or rage.  Naomi stood by her
mother's couch, and saw her wasted form quiver at each
piercing sound, while her clasped hands were convulsively
pressed together, and her eyes looked fervently
upward, as if to seek strength and comfort where only
in that dreadful hour they could be found.  At midday
Zadok and Javan returned together from the scene of
conflict to ascertain her state, and they found her greatly
revived, notwithstanding the constant alarm she was
suffering.  They endeavoured to cheer her by
assurances that the enemy had not yet obtained any
advantage, and that the Jews were bravely repulsing them
from the battlements.  They could not tarry long, for
their presence was urgently required by Simon; but
Zadok's heart was somewhat relieved, for he felt assured
that Salome would yet linger for several days.
</p>

<p>
It was a hot and sultry day: the sun had looked with
unclouded brightness on that once lovely scene, and not
a breath of air came through the open casements to
cool Salome's parched lips, and fan her pallid cheek.
At length he sank in radiant glory behind the western
hills, and a refreshing breeze came over the Mount of
Olives, and Naomi perceived that it revived the languid
spirits of her mother.  She had spoken very little
during the day, and had seemed to wish to be left
undisturbed; but now she turned to her daughter, and
bade her pray for her speedy and happy release.
Naomi complied with her wish, and Salome's eye
beamed with pleasure as she thanked her affectionately
for this, and every act of kindness that she had so
unweariedly bestowed upon her throughout her illness.
</p>

<p>
"You have been to me a blessing from the Lord, my
Naomi: you have watched my poor sinking frame, and
ministered to all its wants, and soothed all its sufferings
with your gentle hand.  But greater far have been the
blessings that you have rendered to my soul: you have
charmed its fears to rest, and taught it to meet the last
enemy with composure, yes, even with joy.  Naomi, my
child, I am going to the presence of God; and it is you
who have pointed out the way."
</p>

<p>
Naomi had learnt to bear the thought of her mother's
death; she had learned to restrain her tears and still her
beating heart, while she watched her panting breath, or
while she joined with her in prayers that cut her to the
soul.  But she could not bear this touching expression
of her mother's gratitude, and she burst into tears of
mingled joy and grief.  But she quickly recovered her
wonted command over her feelings, and Salome continued,
</p>

<p>
"You must not weep for me, Naomi, for I have only
cause to thank my gracious Father, who is so gently
removing me from the evils to come.  The heaviest
weight that now presses on my mind is the fear of what
may be your fate, my child; and the anxious doubts I
feel as to your father's spiritual state, and that of my
poor Javan.  But even these cares I am able to cast on
my Redeemer, remembering that he careth for us."
</p>

<p>
"What joy it is to me, my dear mother, to hear you
speak so peacefully, and to see the calmness that now
pervades your countenance!  I trusted that it would be
so, and that God would give you this perfect peace
before he called you to himself."
</p>

<p>
"He is very merciful, Naomi.  I hope and believe
that He has heard my prayers, and will give me grace
and strength to make a good confession to the last.  I
wish to bear testimony with my latest breath to the
power of our most holy faith, and the goodness and
mercy of our Redeemer.  If my belief in Him, and my
confidence of being pardoned through his merits alone,
sustain me in the hour of death, it will prove to Zadok
that our faith is no vain delusion, but an anchor of the
soul, sure and steadfast.  I only hope that the many
painful doubts which I have experienced of my own
personal interest in His great atonement may not
return, when the shades of death gather round my soul,
to obscure the blessed hope of eternal life that now
sustains me."
</p>

<p>
"It may be, mother, that our great enemy may try
to shake your faith in the hour of weakness.  But
should any doubts arise in your mind, be not troubled.
Remember that your security rests not in the degree of
confidence which you may be enabled to feel, but in the
great things which the Lord Jesus has done for your
soul.  He has once suffered, the just for the unjust, that
he might bring us to God.  He has borne the penalty
of all our sins, and it cannot be that we shall be made
to bear it again.  Our God is faithful and true, and
He must fulfil the promise he has made that not one of
those who come to him in the name of his Son shall
ever perish."
</p>

<p>
"I know it, Naomi, I know it; and on that blessed
promise I rest my dying hope.  When first I believed
in Jesus as the Son of God and the Saviour of men, I
often doubted whether I was one of his flock, one of
those whom he would own as a disciple.  But now that
beautiful promise spoken by his own lips, and which
you so often repeat to me, is able to banish these doubts
I whisper to myself, 'All that the Father giveth me
shall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in
no wise cast out;' and I am at peace.  I know that I
am a vile unworthy sinner; but I know that he is the
unchangeable Jehovah, who keepeth his promise for
ever."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear mother," exclaimed Naomi, "I bless
and glorify God for his goodness to us, in having removed
all your fears, and given you this victory.  Now you
experience the truth of his promises, and find that
though you walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, yet his rod and his staff they comfort you.  Soon
the short passage will be passed, and you will be in the
presence of him who has loved you, and washed you
from your sins in his own blood.  How thankfully do
I feel that I could lay down my head in death, and
follow you to that blessed home!  Were it not for my
father's sake, my spirit would yearn to leave this world,
so full of sorrow and of crime; but while I can try to
soothe his grief, or hope to lead him to the foot of
Jesus' cross, life will still be valuable."
</p>

<p>
"If I did not depend on you to be the solace and
support of your dear father when I am gone," replied
Salome, with a tremulous voice, "death would be much
more terrible to me.  I hope and believe that yet many
years of happiness are reserved for you; and that,
united to Marcellus, you will live an ornament to the
Christian profession.  Zadok will see the power and
beauty of your religion, and he too will embrace the
Saviour.  O Naomi, my soul looks on through many
fancied scenes of life, and rests with joy in the prospect
of greeting all I love on the threshold of heaven!  Yes,
all&mdash;I cannot believe that one will be missing."
</p>

<p>
"God grant it, my mother.  How many of our family
have already been called to the faith of Christ! and we
may hope that his mercy will yet be extended to those
who now reject him.  May He prolong the lives of
my father and brother, and give them time and grace
to repent.  I tremble every hour while this bloody
siege continues, lest they should be suddenly called into
eternity before they have sought pardon through Jesus
Christ."
</p>

<p>
"It is a fearful thought," replied Salome.  "And
when the conquering arms of Rome have found an
entrance into our wretched city, what will be their fate?
Perhaps to be slain with the sword&mdash;perhaps to be led
away captive into a heathen land, where the Saviour's
name will not be heard.  Oh, I must banish these
dreadful thoughts, for they pierce my soul with agony.
Naomi, bring your harp, and sing to me that hymn
which has so often soothed me to repose.  I am weary,
and this has been a long, long day to me.  I marvel that
your father does not return, for the sounds of war have
died away while we have been conversing."
</p>

<p>
It was true; the battle had ceased for that day, and the
exhausted combatants had retired as daylight departed,
to prepare for a fiercer conflict on the morrow.  No
sounds now fell on Salome's ear but the sighing of the
evening breeze and the hoarse cry of the vultures as
they hovered over the pestilent streets.  The gusts of
air that entered the open casements of her chamber
were tainted with the foul vapours of the city, though
Naomi had placed her vases of blooming flowers within
the window, in the hope of excluding the noxious odour.
In the midst of all her other cares and anxieties, these
favourite plants were watched and tended for her
mother's sake, and their bright blossoms, so pure and
fragrant in the midst of death and corruption, were
an emblem of the purity of Naomi's spirit and the
beauty of her holy faith, that remained unsullied amid
the depravity that surrounded her, and only grew
brighter and more lovely as the path in which she
walked became darker.  Nothing but that faith could
have supported the Jewish maid under her present
trials, or have enabled her to bear the prospect of those
which she anticipated.  Nothing but the firm assurance
that her Redeemer's eye was upon her, and His arm
sustaining her, and that all things would work together
for good to those who loved God, could have enabled
her to maintain a calm and almost a cheerful spirit in
that time of matchless woe.  Nothing but a perfect
confidence that her mother's soul was about to wing its
way to a realm of unutterable bliss, and that the same
faith which opened the portals of heaven to Salome's
ransomed spirit, would also enable her to join her
there, could have taught her to look on the dying
and beloved form before her and not feel that her heart
was breaking.
</p>

<p>
Naomi took her harp, which was once her greatest
pleasure and most frequent occupation, but now was
never touched except when Salome wished to be soothed
by its plaintive sound.  She seated herself near the
open casement, where she could look out on the Mount
of Olives and the more distant Hills of Judgment, now
illuminated by the rising moon, and in a low sweet voice
she sang her mother's favourite hymn.

<p>
When Zadok and his son left the temple to proceed
towards their home, their attention was attracted by
a strong light which arose from that part of the upper
city where the great prison was situated.  They paused
to watch it for a moment, and they soon perceived that
the prison was on fire; and from the distant clamour
and the shouts that proceeded from the spot, they
suspected that it was an act intentionally committed by
some of the wild insurgents.  Javan hastily summoned
a party of his own men who were assembled in the
temple court, and then begging his father to return
home without him, he added,
</p>

<p>
"I must hasten to the prison; there is one within
those walls who must not perish thus."
</p>

<p>
"Of whom do you speak, Javan?" replied his father.
"All the best and most valuable men in our city have
already passed from the prisons to death; and who
remains for whom you feel so keen an interest?
Whoever it may be, I will go with you to rescue him
from the dreadful fate that seems to threaten all the
captives."
</p>

<p>
"Come then, my father," said Javan; "let us lose
no time, and you may yet see one whom you never
thought to behold again on earth.  Theophilus lives in
that blazing pile, and we may save him."
</p>

<p>
"Theophilus lives!" cried Zadok.  "Oh let us fly to
preserve him!  When he is safe I will hear all you have
to tell of him&mdash;but now let us not waste a moment."
</p>

<p>
They hurried through the streets followed by their
armed attendants, and soon reached the area in front of
the prison.  It presented a scene of confusion and uproar
that baffled description.  The building had been set on
fire by a party of Zealots, who had previously made an
ineffectual attempt to force open the gates and release
the prisoners, many of whom were criminals of their own
faction, confined by order of Simon.  These wretches
now appeared at the grated windows of their cells, and
with frantic gestures and cries of terror, besought their
comrades to burst open the door and set them free
before the fire should spread through the building.  A
multitude of both factions were collected in the square,
and a fierce struggle was going on near the gates; the
Zealots endeavouring to tear them down, and those of
Simon's parry striving to repulse them.  Meanwhile
flames were raging furiously, and volumes of smoke
and fire came down upon the crowd; while the shrieks
of the prisoners, the shouts of the combatants, and the
crash of falling timbers combined to increase the horror
of the scene.
</p>

<p>
Javan was bold and resolute in the highest degree.
No danger ever deterred him from prosecuting an object
which he earnestly desired to accomplish.  Collecting
his followers into a compact body, he placed himself at
their head; and accompanied by his no less courageous
father, he forced his way through the crowd, and
reached a small door in the outer wall of the prison.
To Zadok's surprise he produced a key which instantly
opened this door, and they entered the court-yard.
The same key admitted them into the building, which
they found filled with a dense smoke and intensely
heated by the rapidly-increasing flames.  Nevertheless,
Javan and Zadok rushed forward; and as they reached
the door which led to Theophilus's cell they saw that
all the further extremity of the passage was enveloped
in a sheet of fire.  They entered the cell, which was
partially illuminated by the light of the flames which
had seized the opposite side of the court.  On the
ground near the narrow window Theophilus was on his
knees: his hands, from which hung heavy chains, were
clasped in the attitude of fervent prayer, and his pale
countenance was turned towards Heaven with an
expression of heroic and saintlike resignation.  The
creaking of the massy door aroused his attention, and in a
moment his eyes met those of Zadok, and he felt himself
embraced with warm affection by his uncle.  Javan
stood aloof.  He had visited Theophilus many times
in that solitary cell, and his appearance did not awaken
any fresh emotions in his stern breast.
</p>

<p>
"Come, my father," he cried, "this is no time for
greetings or explanations.  The flames are drawing
nearer, and even now our passage may be stopped."
</p>

<p>
Zadok caught the arm of Theophilus, and supported
him while they passed swiftly through the narrow
gallery, and retraced the way by which he and Javan
had entered.  In the court they met the rushing
crowd from without, for the great gates had now been
burnt down, and a free entrance was afforded to those
who sought to release the terrified captives.  Through
this tumultuous band they wound their way, and at
length reached the open area in safety.  Onward they
pressed, and did not pause to speak or rest, though
Theophilus, weakened by long confinement and want
of proper nourishment, could scarcely keep pace with
his companions.  Through all the time of famine, Javan
had carefully provided for his cousin's sustenance; but
it was not in his power to obtain for him more than
would barely sustain life; and his once manly form was
wasted away, and all his natural strength had forsaken
him.
</p>

<p>
When they had descended the eminence on which
the prison stood, they entered one of the most frequented
streets.  How changed was all around since Theophilus
had beheld that once splendid part of the city!  The
houses in ruins, or wearing an air of desolation that
eloquently told of the miseries of their inhabitants; and
the street that was wont to be crowded with passengers,
and animated with the hum of many voices, now
silent and deserted&mdash;peopled only with livid corpses,
and a few straggling wretches, whose forms and countenances
were scarcely less spectral than those that lay
stiff and cold beneath their feet.  In the frequent visits
which Javan had paid to his cousin's cell, he had informed
him of the progress of the war, and the cruel factions
that divided the city; but Theophilus had not pictured
to himself a scene of such utter desolation as that which
now met his view in the clear cold light of the moon.
He eagerly questioned Zadok as to the welfare of his
family and friends amid the general misery that seemed
to prevail; and he learned with deep distress of the
hopeless state to which his aunt was reduced, and the
sufferings and privations to which all the family had
been subjected.  Zadok also learned from him the
particulars of his preservation, which though they had been
told to both Naomi and her mother, had been purposely
concealed by Javan from his father, lest he should
interfere to procure his liberation.  It had been only
under a solemn promise of secrecy that the happy
intelligence of Theophilus's safety had been confided to
Naomi and Salome; and thus Javan had been enabled
to pursue his plans without interruption.
</p>

<p>
It was the restoration of his cousin to the Jewish
religion, and not his death, that had actuated Javan
after he had once secured his person; and in the hope
of obtaining this object, he had contrived to substitute
another condemned criminal in the place of Theophilus
on the dreadful day of execution.  The malefactor was
clothed in the vest and robe of him whom he was
appointed to personate; and none of those who felt any
interest in the transaction had the slightest suspicion of
the change that had been made.  Executions and
murders were events of too common occurrence to excite
much attention from the self-constituted authorities that
tyrannised over the city; and Javan's artifice was
known only to the jailor, who was a faithful and devoted
adherent of his own.  For a considerable time Javan
had visited the Christian captive daily, and patiently
argued with him on what he considered his fatal errors.
But latterly his time had been too much occupied with
the business of this siege, to allow of his devoting many
hours to what had hitherto been a fruitless labour; and
he had seldom seen Theophilus.  Still he felt a strong
desire that he should live to behold that glorious advent
of the Messiah which he was himself daily expecting&mdash;he
wished that, since all his arguments had failed, that
awful event might break on the eyes of his deluded
cousin, and at once dispel his errors, and convince him
that until that moment the true Messiah had never
appeared on earth.  Therefore he took every precaution
for his being provided with food, and frequently denied
himself that Theophilus might be preserved from dying
in the state of hopeless apostasy in which he believed him
to be sunk.
</p>

<p>
It was with the same feeling that he had this evening
hazarded his own life to rescue the man whom he had so
deeply injured from a dreadful death; and as he strode
rapidly before his father and Theophilus, his soul was
occupied in contemplations of approaching triumph and
prosperity, in which he believed that all who shared the
pure blood of Aaron, that ran in his own veins, would
take a distinguished part.
</p>

<p>
He led the way through dark and narrow streets with
which he was well acquainted, and which at length
brought them to the private entrance, at the back of
Zadok's house, near the city wall.  They entered the
door, and immediately met old Deborah, whose astonishment
and terror, at the sight of one whom she had so
long believed to be dead, were extreme.  She thought
it must be a spectre, and would have hurried away
trembling with fear, had not Zadok detained her, and
briefly informed her of the truth.  With some difficulty
he and Javan detached the fetters from the hands of
Theophilus, and he then passed out on the terrace,
followed by the two young men, as he wished to enter
Salome's chamber alone, and leave them without until
he had prepared her to meet Theophilus.  With a gentle
step he approached towards the open casement, which
was his usual mode of entrance, and as he heard the
sound of Naomi's harp, he felt assured that all was well,
He paused to listen, and to contemplate the scene which
met his view within the apartment, as the dark shadow
of the wall concealed him from observation: and Naomi
continued her song, with all the feeling and tender
expression of devotion with which the words inspired
her.
</p>

<p>
Javan and Theophilus drew near to Zadok, and with
various feelings they heard the song of Christian faith
which Naomi had composed for her mother's consolation.
In Theophilus's breast it inspired a sensation of delighted
surprise and gratitude; in Javan's, of zealous indignation,
which almost prompted him to rush forward and
interrupt the blasphemous strain.  In Zadok's heart
were many mingled feelings that held him motionless
and almost breathless, until the last chord died away
on the harp of Naomi, and all was profound silence.
</p>

<p>
Salome's couch was near the window, and the rich
curtains of Tyrian purple had been drawn aside to admit
the refreshing evening breeze.  She lay calm and still,
listening to her daughter's voice, while a sweet smile
rested on her deathlike countenance.  Her eyes were
closed, and she did not see the tears that ran unchecked
down Naomi's cheek while she sang her mother's dirge
of death.  Deep emotion had called up a bright and
hectic flush to that usually pallid cheek; but when her
song was done, and she leaned silently upon her harp,
the transient colour faded rapidly away, like the last
brilliant rays of the setting sun dying on the cold
summit of a snow-capped mountain.
</p>

<p>
Theophilus was deeply moved.  When last he parted
from his cousin she was in the pride of youth and beauty,
and the animation of her soul looked forth from her
beaming eyes.  But never had she looked so lovely as
now, in her sorrow and resignation.  She seemed a
being too pure and unearthly to tarry in this world of
sin and woe, and as if she were only waiting for her
summons to that heavenly home where her heart and
her treasure were already laid up.
</p>

<p>
After a pause of some duration, Zadok approached
the window and entered the apartment.  Naomi met him
without embarrassment, for she had ceased to fear that
he would rebuke her for speaking of Jesus to her mother,
and she saw in his countenance no traces of displeasure.
Salome too looked up with a peaceful smile, and asked
whether he had heard any part of Naomi's song.  He
did not reply to the question, but affectionately inquired
how she had passed the day since he had seen her, and
spoke of the prison being on fire as the cause of his
long delay in returning to her.  Salome knew that it
was the prison in which Theophilus had been confined,
and she listened with returning animation to the account
of his rescue and safe arrival at his uncle's house.  She
begged to see him immediately, and Theophilus was
quickly at her side.  The near approach of death had
already destroyed the keenness of her sensibilities, and
she met him with much greater composure than he could
command; while Naomi was hardly able to control her
feelings at the recollection of all that she and her cousin
and poor Claudia had undergone, since their last meeting
in the prison.  Javan did not join them until they had
had time to converse on the past and the future; and
mutually to relate the events and the feelings that had
marked the period since they parted.  It was with
sincere delight that Theophilus heard of Claudia's pious
resignation and strengthened faith; and he blessed God
for all that they had suffered, since it had been the means
of confirming her faith and proving its sincerity.  Long
the cousins discoursed together, while Zadok remained
by Salome's side, and saw with satisfaction that she sank
into a deep and tranquil slumber.  Still there was an
altered appearance in her countenance that spoke fearfully
to his heart, and he would not leave the room to
seek the repose which he so much needed.
</p>

<p>
Javan and Theophilus retired, but Naomi took her
place by her father, and together they watched in silence
while Salome slept.  Deborah also tarried, and gazed
with tearful eyes on her beloved mistress, who she plainly
saw would very soon be taken from their sight.  About
midnight she awoke, and appeared so much revived that
a faint gleam of hope arose in Zadok's breast that he
was not so soon to lose her.  But it was only the last
light of an expiring lamp ere it sinks to darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Zadok, my beloved," she said, and she laid her cold
hand on his, "the hour is fast approaching when I must
close my eyes for ever, and look on your face no more
in this world.  Call my son and Theophilus hither,
that with my latest breath I may bear witness to the
truth."
</p>

<p>
Deborah quickly summoned the two young men, and
in breathless attention they all stood round the couch.
</p>

<p>
"I bless the Lord, my dear Theophilus," continued
Salome, in a low but distinct voice, "that He has
permitted me to see you once more, and given me this
opportunity of telling you how much I owe to your
noble example in awakening my interest towards the
religion which supported you, and proving to me that
it was indeed from Heaven.  I am now on the verge
of that eternity into which I so long believed that you had
entered; and here, in the presence of God, and of those
who are dearest to me on earth, I testify that Jesus of
Nazareth is the true Messiah.  He has revealed himself
to my soul, as the only Saviour from sin and condemnation;
and in His name I meet death without a fear.
Oh, my dearest husband, and you too, my son, let my
dying voice persuade you to seek the refuge which I
have found, and save your souls alive."
</p>

<p>
She paused, but none replied, and after a short interval
she proceeded.
</p>

<p>
"The evil days are come upon us&mdash;those days of
which the Redeemer warned our fathers, and in the
scenes which surround us we behold the proof of his
divine foreknowledge.  The awful completion of his
prophecy is yet to come, for not one jot or tittle of all
that he spoke shall pass away unfulfilled.  Then, when
Jerusalem is trampled down, and our holy temple cast
to the ground, where will you look for safety, Zadok?
Not on the earth, for our nation will be led away captive
by the heathen, and persecuted in every land.  Turn ye
then to the stronghold ordained before the world was
created, as the only sure refuge in the time of trouble.
Why should ye refuse to believe in Him who spake as
never man spake, and who fulfilled all that the prophets
foretold of him?"
</p>

<p>
"Mother," cried Javan, unable any longer to listen
to her with composure, "mother, I implore you to cease,
and not let your last words be words of blasphemy!  I
cannot hear the majesty of Jehovah thus insulted, and a
crucified malefactor exalted to his throne, and hold my
peace.  Speak no more of the Nazarene; or suffer me
to retire, ere I forget my love and reverence for you in
zeal for the honour of my God."
</p>

<p>
"Javan, Javan! are you so hardened in prejudice?
I cannot cease to tell of all that Jesus has done for
my soul while yet I have strength to speak; and I
would to God that my voice might sink deep into your
heart, and leave an impression there never to be effaced.
Will you not stay and hear my testimony?  Then
farewell, my son, and may the Saviour whom you despise
yet look graciously on you, and bring you to himself."
</p>

<p>
Javan took his mother's hand, which was feebly
extended towards him: he kissed her cheek with
tenderness, and then hurried from the room to hide the
emotions which he could not command.
</p>

<p>
"He is gone, and may the Spirit of the Lord follow
him," said Salome, with a heavy sigh.  "Zadok, you
are less obdurate.  I see that conviction begins to steal
upon your soul.  Do not deny it; do not take from me
the hope that enables me to part from you with
resignation.  When I am in my cold grave, you will remember
what I have said to you, and know that it was truth."
</p>

<p>
Again she paused to recover strength for all she
wished to say, and those who stood weeping round her
couch did not attempt to interrupt her.  There was a
tone of holy dignity, almost of inspiration, in this her
dying discourse, that held them in silent and reverential
attention.
</p>

<p>
"Naomi, my child," she continued, in a fainter voice,
"come near and receive my parting blessing."  Naomi
Rank on her knees, and stifling the emotions that shook
her trembling form, she waited in silence for her mother's
benediction.
</p>

<p>
"May the God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, bless thee, my Naomi, and keep thee in all thy
ways.  May He reward thee a hundredfold for all that
thou hast been to me; and may he grant that you may
prove as great a blessing to your beloved father's soul
as thou hast been to mine.  And oh, when thy earthly
course is finished, and thy spirit soars above, to enter
the blissful mansions prepared for thee by our Redeemer's
love, may it be my happy privilege to meet thee on the
threshold, and conduct thee to the foot of the throne,
and there to testify that thy teaching and thy example
first led me into the heavenly road."
</p>

<p>
Naomi pressed her mother's hand to her lips, and
bathed it with her tears, but she could not speak; and
Zadok and Theophilus knelt beside her.
</p>

<p>
"Pray for me, Zadok," said Salome.  "The shadows
of death are gathering round me, and your voice should
be the last&mdash;it has ever been the dearest&mdash;that I hear
on earth."
</p>

<p>
The priest complied with his wife's request; and had
his prayer been uttered in the Saviour's name, it would
have been all that Salome's soul desired.  The conclusion
was consoling to her, and strengthened her hopes
of his conversion; for he prayed that he might meet his
wife in heaven, and that if there were in his own creed
anything that obstructed his heavenward course, the
Lord would deign to remove his error, and lead him into
all truth.  This was a concession which neither Salome
nor her daughter had expected, and they heard it with
secret thanksgiving and joy.
</p>

<p>
Salome closed her eyes, and Zadok thought she slept;
but soon she opened them again, and fixed them on his
countenance with a look of anxious affection.
</p>

<p>
"Remember, my beloved," she whispered, "remember
your promise.  Read the book of life, and
believe.  And I have one more request.  Be very kind
to our poor Naomi when I am gone, and do not suffer
her to be reviled or harshly treated because she believes
in Jesus."
</p>

<p>
"Were she less dear to me than she is," replied
Zadok, "she should be guarded and cherished as the
apple of my eye for your sake, my love.  Fear not,
Salome, I will be a father and a friend to her; and
none shall deal unkindly with her while Zadok lives
to protect her.  And more than this&mdash;she shall tell me
of this Jesus, whose name has become so dear to your
soul; and I will listen with sincerity, remembering that
it was your dying wish."
</p>

<p>
"The blessing of my Heavenly Father be upon you
for these words, my dearest husband!" exclaimed Salome,
with sudden energy.  "Now will my soul depart in
peace, for its fondest desires are granted.  Bless thou
the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me praise
his holy name!"
</p>

<p>
It seemed that Salome's heart was now relieved of all
its anxious cares, for her countenance beamed with a
heavenly calmness; and while she held the hand of
Zadok clasped within both her own, she fell asleep.  For
some hours she lay motionless, while her low and
lengthened breathing alone declared that life was not
extinct.  But there was light and conscious joy in her
spirit, though its earthly tabernacle seemed already
stricken by the hand of death.  At length her lips
moved, and in a voice scarcely audible she murmured,
</p>

<p>
"O grave, where is thy sting!  O death, where is thy
victory!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell us, dear Salome," said Theophilus, leaning over
her affectionately, "tell us, is it all peace?"
</p>

<p>
"Triumph! triumph! as far as I have gone," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"And you have no fears, no doubts, no darkness
around you?" he continued, anxious that Zadok should
know how well her faith sustained her to the last.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no!" she slowly and distinctly answered.  "The
valley is all light now.  I see heaven opening beyond it.
I see the redeemed with their golden harps, and almost
I hear their songs of joy.  There is no darkness there,
for the Lamb is the light thereof."
</p>

<p>
More she tried to say, but no sound came from her
parted lips, and her voice was never heard again on
earth.  So gently, so imperceptibly her breathing died
away, that none knew at what moment her spirit fled
to God.  Zadok felt her hands unclasp their hold of
his, and they became cold and still.  With trembling
steps Deborah approached, and drew aside the drapery
that had hitherto excluded the light of the rising sun;
and as the first beams darted brightly over the summit of
Mount Olivet, they fell on the lifeless form of Salome,
and showed the hue of death on her cold features.
</p>

<p>
The agony of grief, which had been so long repressed
in the bosom of Zadok, now burst forth with somewhat
of the fervent feeling for which his race was
distinguished; and he mourned over the dead with bitter
tears.  Theophilus led him and his daughter from the
chamber, to that in which Javan sat gloomy and sad;
and the meeting of Naomi and her brother was deeply
painful to both.
</p>

<p>
The circumstances in which the city was placed were
such as to prevent the greatest part of the ceremonies
which usually followed the death of a Jewish matron
from being performed.  Deborah exerted herself, with
the assistance of the other domestics, to supply every
deficiency, and Javan was zealously anxious that nothing
of the customary forms should be omitted that could
possibly be attended to.  He summoned the rabbi
Joazer, and concerted with him as to the funeral of his
mother, which by Zadok's desire was to take place that
very day.  He would not suffer the remains of his
beloved wife to be carried out into the polluted streets,
and he resolved that she should be laid beneath the
shady trees in the garden attached to his house.  The
custom of the Jews forbad a priest from touching a
corpse, or even remaining in the house which contained
one.  Zadok therefore went forth and wandered up and
down the desolate street while the hasty preparations
were made.  Then, when the body was carried down to
the simple grave that had been dug by the servants of
the household, he repaired to the terrace with Naomi;
and though he was not legally permitted to be present at
a funeral, yet he stood there to see the mortal body of
his beloved wife laid in the dust; and he was enabled to
lift his eyes to Heaven with gratitude that she had been
taken away from the evil to come, and with the hope
that ere long he should rejoin her beyond the clear blue
sky that now glowed brightly over his head.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
</h3>

<p>
This was no time for the indulgence of sorrow.  Soon
after the green turf was laid over the grave of Salome, a
messenger arrived from Simon to demand the immediate
appearance of Javan at the temple, as the gates were
about to be fired by order of Titus, and every hand
was required to prevent the execution of the dreadful
project.  Javan hurried to the spot, accompanied by his
father and Theophilus, and they found that all the fears
of the besieged were realized.  Blazing torches had been
applied to the gates, and the plates of silver that covered
them had become intensely heated.  The wooden framework
had caught fire, and as they entered the court
they saw the flames spring up in several directions.
They joined their companions and friends in exhorting
the soldiers to make every effort to extinguish the
fire or arrest its further progress; but a panic had
seized the men, hitherto so dauntless, and in silent
dismay they watched the flames rising higher and fiercer,
until in a short time they were communicated to the
inner cloisters.  The besieged now saw a circle of fire
spreading round them, and destruction threatening
themselves and their magnificent temple.  All day the
flames raged with violence, and the whole of the rich
and beautiful cloisters were in ruins, while the officers
and leaders of the Jews used ineffectual efforts to rouse
their men from the state of consternation into which they
and sunk.  At night, Zadok and Theophilus returned
to Naomi for a few hours, but Javan remained with his
chieftain, resolved to share his dangers and assist his
councils.
</p>

<p>
When morning dawned Zadok prepared to leave his
home once more, and join his son amid the burning
walls of the sacred edifice, to defend them, or to perish
beneath their ruins.  Naomi felt a dark foreboding, as
her father came to bid her farewell, that it might be the
last time she should receive his affectionate embrace, or
listen to a benediction from his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my father," she cried, while she fell at his feet
and embraced his knees, "do not leave me&mdash;do not rush
into certain destruction.  The hour is at hand when our
city will be trodden by the Gentiles, and it is in vain to
resist the decrees of Heaven.  Tarry with me, I implore
you, and let me meet death by your side."
</p>

<p>
"Do not abandon yourself to despair, my child,"
replied Zadok, raising her from the ground and pressing
her fondly to his heart.  "All is not yet lost; and
though my hopes of triumph and deliverance are fading
away, yet still there may be an effectual resistance made
to the enemy, and we may obtain terms from the
conqueror.  I will return to you if immediate danger
threatens the city, and Theophilus shall remain to
support and comfort you.  A sacred duty calls me to
the temple, and as a servant of the living God I must
not abandon His sanctuary.  Farewell, my Naomi;
may the blessing of the Almighty rest upon you."
</p>

<p>
He left her, and she gazed after him through her
tears until the gates of the courtyard closed behind him
and hid his manly form from her view.  Theophilus
would not leave his cousin alone to her grief and
apprehensions.  He knew that his presence in the temple
could be of no avail to arrest the approaching ruin, and
therefore he remained to cheer the drooping spirit of
Naomi, and if necessary, to die in her defence.
</p>

<p>
It was now the 10th of August, that fatal day which
had already proved so calamitous to Jerusalem, when
the Temple of Solomon was destroyed by the Babylonian
king.  Titus beheld the spreading flames that threatened
the total demolition of the second glorious temple of
Jehovah, and he was moved to pity that so much splendour
and beauty should be laid in ruins.  He called a
council of war, and solemnly discussed with his officers
the question whether the sacred edifice should be
preserved, or left to the effects of the destroying element.
Many of his advisers were of opinion that the temple
should no longer be regarded as a sanctuary, but as a
fortress, and that it ought to be treated like any other
stronghold of rebellion.  But Titus was inclined towards
milder measures.  The magnificence of the building had
struck him with profound admiration, and he wished to
preserve it as one of the proudest ornaments of the
Roman empire.  In this desire he was seconded by
several of his principal officers, and by Marcellus more
warmly than the rest, and orders were instantly issued
for the soldiers to unite their efforts to extinguish the
flames.
</p>

<p>
It was in vain; a higher decree than that of Titus
had doomed the temple to destruction, and his legions
were unable to stay the course of the sword of Divine
vengeance.  While they toiled in fruitless zeal for the
preservation of the devoted building, the Jews suddenly
roused themselves and shook off the terror which had
kept them inactive all the preceding day and night, and
desperate thoughts of vengeance seized on their minds.
Led on by Simon and Javan, they made a furious sally
from the eastern gate upon the guards who were posted
in the outer court.  The Romans locked their shields
together and received the shock with unbroken ranks;
but such multitudes of the besieged came rushing upon
them that Titus himself was obliged to come to their
defence, and with a choice band of men he at length
succeeded in repulsing the Jews, and driving them back
from the court into the temple again.  He then withdrew
into the Antonia, intending to make a general and
final assault on the following morning.  After he had
retired, a party of the besieged, not discouraged by their
repulse in the morning, made another attack upon the
soldiers who were still employed in extinguishing the
fire in the cloisters.  The Romans drove them back,
and followed them within the sacred precincts even to
the door of the temple itself.  One of the legionaries,
animated with fury and a love of destruction, climbed on
the shoulders of a comrade who stood before him, and
threw a lighted torch through a small gilded door into
the porch.  The flames at once sprang up, and the Jews
uttered one wild and general shriek of consternation and
rage, and grasping their swords, resolved to revenge the
sacrilegious act and perish in the ruins of the temple.
Titus was asleep when Marcellus rushed into his chamber
with the startling intelligence that the temple was on
fire.  He started up, and they both hastened to the spot,
which was already crowded with Roman soldiers.  With
shouts and gestures the general commanded his men to
quench the flames, but his voice was unheeded or drowned
in the deafening clamour that surrounded him.
</p>

<p>
The legionaries rushed on: many of them cast flaming
torches into the inner court, and then, drawing their
swords, turned to the work of slaughter.  Thousands
fell in the first onset, and the temple steps flowed with
blood, though Titus made every exertion in his power to
put a stop to the carnage.  He entered the temple with
his officers, and gazed in wonder and admiration on the
matchless splendour that met his view.  As yet the holy
place was untouched by the fire, and he made a last effort
to save it.  But one of the soldiers privately contrived to
thrust a torch between the hinges of the door, and in a
few moments the building was enveloped in flames.  Titus
and his companions were forced to retire, and the whole
of the glorious structure was abandoned to ruin.  One
by one the different parts of the building fell in with a
tremendous crash.  The cedar roofs became a sheet of
flame, and the towers and pinnacles rose in columns of
fire high above the rest of the edifice.  The light spread
far and wide, and was reflected from the neighbouring
hills with a lurid glow.
</p>

<p>
At this awful moment the son of Ananus once more
appeared.  Wild and ghastly he stalked through the
courts of the temple, and mounted the tottering wall.
He gazed around him on the scene of desolation that so
fearfully fulfilled his oft-repeated prophecy.  Then he
cried with a loud voice, "Woe to myself!" and as he
spoke, a stone that was cast from the engines below struck
him, and he fell backward a corpse in the flaming ruins.
</p>

<p>
What were the sensations of the horror-stricken
inhabitants when they were aroused by the shout that burst
from the temple when the conflagration broke out!  They
looked towards the holy hill, and beheld its summit a mass
of glowing flames.  Fear and wrath and dire revenge
animated the pale countenances of these famished and
woe-worn men; and from the streets of the upper city
were heard such cries of anguish and despair as reached
the rocks and hills around, and were echoed back to
mingle with the shouts of the Roman soldiers, and the
dying groans of those who were perishing in the flames.
In the midst of the confusion John of Gischala, ever
intent on his own preservation, rushed out of the temple
with a band of Zealots, and succeeded in forcing his way
through the crowd and reaching the upper city in safety.
At a later period a larger body of his adherents also took
refuge there; but the priests and the greater portion of
the Jewish leaders remained in the burning pile.
</p>

<p>
Every part of the temple was ransacked by the Roman
soldiers, who climbed over heaps of slain to seize on the
treasures that gleamed on all sides.  The wealth that
had been laid up by the Zealots was discovered and
borne away, with the gold and jewels and rich vestments
belonging to the service of the sanctuary; and even the
bodies of the slaughtered priests were stripped of their
embroidered vests and ornamented girdles by the rapacious
hands of the victorious troops.  One small band of
Romans were seen hurrying through the courts, engaged
in a different pursuit to that of their fellow-soldiers.  They
were Marcellus and a few of his faithful friends seeking
to discover and save Zadok the priest.  They were
passing by the altar where he had been wont to minister in
his course, when they observed a Roman soldier tearing
away the golden clasp from the girdle of a slaughtered
priest.  Marcellus sprang forward, and beheld the lifeless
countenance of Naomi's father.  He had fallen beside
the altar, and his features even in death wore the
expression of dignified calmness that seldom deserted him in
any event of life.  Marcellus had arrested the plundering
hand of the soldier, and as he stooped to replace the vestments
of the priest, his eye fell on a roll of parchment that
had been concealed in the folds of his garment.  He took
it up, and what was his astonishment at perceiving that
it was a copy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ!  Could it be
possible that Zadok believed that Gospel?  He secured
the precious volume in his own vest, and with the assistance
of his comrades bore the body of the priest to that
part of the building where the fire was spreading most
rapidly.  They cast it into the flames, and left it to be
consumed on that glorious funeral pile; safe from the
insults which were heaped on the mangled forms of his
brethren by the brutal soldiery.
</p>

<p>
This pious act performed, Marcellus sought for his
commander, and obtained from him permission to lead a
sufficient body of men from the temple to secure the house
and family of Zadok from injury.  Already a number of
persons had escaped from the burning ruins, and were
rushing distractedly through the streets of the lower city
and that portion of the town which was connected with
the temple.  They were pursued by parties of the
victorious troops, and the alarm was spread that the whole
body of the Romans was coming down to bring fire and
sword among the wretched inhabitants.  Marcellus
hurried on; he dreaded that even now he might be too late to
save Naomi and her mother from danger and alarm.  All
whom he approached in traversing the well-known streets
that led to Zadok's dwelling, fled before him, supposing
that he and his followers came only to destroy.
</p>

<p>
The flames of the burning temple illuminated the whole
of the city, and by that terrific light Marcellus saw what
ravages famine and the sword had made among the
inhabitants.  He stepped shuddering over the decaying
corpses that polluted the streets; and when his eye
glanced upward he met the despairing gaze of many a
spectral countenance watching him from the windows of
the houses, and shrinking with terror at his approach.
</p>

<p>
The intrepid young soldier trembled with anxiety as he
reached the gate of Zadok's house.  Perhaps he should
find his beloved Naomi a ghastly corpse!  Could she have
survived so much horror and privation?  The gate was
closed and secured inside, but it yielded to the united
and powerful efforts of the soldiers, and Marcellus entered
the courtyard.  It was silent and deserted, for the
domestics had fled to hide themselves at the dreaded
approach of the Romans.  Marcellus stationed the greatest
part of his men in the court to prevent the entrance of
any who might come for plunder or destruction; and
attended only by two of his party, he proceeded with a
beating heart to search the house for the objects of his
anxiety.  He found them not in the apartments, and he
passed out upon the terrace.  The red light that burnt so
fiercely above fell upon the garden beneath the terrace,
and he beheld a female form kneeling on the turf, while
by her side stood one who seemed resolved to protect her
or perish with her.  An aged woman was near them, who
uttered a shriek of terror as by the light of the
conflagration she beheld three Roman soldiers appear on the
terrace.  Her scream awakened the kneeling maiden to
a remembrance of her perilous situation, and she sprang
to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Slay her, Theophilus!" cried Deborah, in an accent
of despair; "plunge your sword to her heart, and save
her from the Roman conquerors.  Better far to see her
life-blood flow on the grave of her mother, than that
she should be borne away a captive in the hands of the
idolaters!"
</p>

<p>
Theophilus gazed on his trembling and lovely charge.
Had he been any other than a disciple of Christ&mdash;had
he not surely believed that her Lord and Saviour was
able to protect her, and that come what may, his
followers must endure to the end, and possess their soul
in patience, he would have yielded to the wild entreaty
of Deborah, and at once have put an end to Naomi's
sufferings and dangers.  He supported her sinking form,
for now at last her courage and firmness deserted her,
and she would have fallen to the ground had not
Theophilus caught her in his arms, and held her while the
dreaded enemy approached.
</p>

<p>
Marcellus commanded his men to remain on the terrace
and sprang down the steps alone, crying loudly,
</p>

<p>
"Naomi, my own betrothed Naomi! you have nothing
to fear: it is Marcellus."
</p>

<p>
His words were unheeded by Naomi, for she had
fainted; and when he reached the spot where Theophilus
stood in grateful astonishment, he snatched her senseless
form from the arms of her cousin, and tears rolled
down his manly cheeks as he gazed on her deathlike
countenance.
</p>

<p>
"Look up, my Naomi," he cried; "look up, and see
that it is Marcellus who supports you.  I have looked
forward to this moment in the midst of bloodshed and
danger; I have hoped to see your beloved face, as the
reward of every toil.  O gracious God! may not my
hopes be snatched from me now in this hour of meeting!"
</p>

<p>
It was long before Naomi's senses returned; but at
length she opened her eyes, and looked wildly round,
expecting to see none but her most dreaded enemies.
What words shall describe her feelings when she saw the
countenance of Marcellus, and heard his exclamation of
rapture at this sign of returning life!  Joy was almost as
overpowering as fear, and for a few moments deprived her
of utterance.  But a delightful feeling of perfect security
came over her soul, and she soon recovered.  Marcellus
was with her&mdash;what earthly dangers could she fear?
</p>

<p>
The surprise and joy of Deborah were more loudly
expressed than that of Naomi.  She poured forth her
gratitude, mingled with inquiries and conjectures, which
Marcellus was too much absorbed to reply to.  But
Naomi had no sooner become convinced of the reality
of her own happiness than her thoughts reverted to her
father, and she eagerly inquired whether Marcellus had
obtained any information respecting him.  He would
have evaded the question and deferred the sad
intelligence, but Naomi marked his countenance, and her
quick eye detected that he had something to conceal.
</p>

<p>
"I know it," she exclaimed; "I know the worst.  My
father has fallen, and I am an orphan indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"It is but too true, my Naomi," replied Marcellus;
"Zadok has fallen bravely, in the defence of his hallowed
altar.  I saw his reverend form, and I secured it from
insult; it was all that I could do.  And see," he added,
drawing forth the well-known manuscript, "this sacred
volume was near his heart; may we hope that its truths
were known and valued there?"
</p>

<p>
"God grant it!" cried the weeping Naomi.  "He
had ceased to despise them, but the Lord alone knows
how far he had received them.  His soul was devoted
to the service of God in sincerity and truth, and I trust
that it is now rejoicing in His presence."
</p>

<p>
"And your mother, Naomi, has she also departed
from this world."
</p>

<p>
"But yesterday she was laid beneath this turf,
Marcellus; I may not mourn for her, for she died in the
faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, and her end was full of
blessedness."
</p>

<p>
"The Lord be praised!" said Marcellus.  "Naomi,
my father will be a father to you; and it will be my
happy task to cheer your spirit, after all that you have
suffered.  The night of affliction has been very dark
around you, my love; but we may hope that a joyful
morning will yet dawn forth even in this world, and
that our future lives may show our gratitude to the
Lord, who has brought us through so many trials, and
permitted us at length to meet each other though in
circumstances of so much sorrow.  Come, Theophilus,
my long-lost brother, we must return to the house, and
take measures for its security; and you shall tell me
how it is that I see you here alive&mdash;you who have so
long been wept as dead, and mourned for by the widowed
heart of my poor sister."
</p>

<p>
Theophilus gave his friend a short relation of his
preservation and subsequent existence in the prison,
and in his turn he heard from Marcellus of all that
Claudia had suffered on his account, and of her faithful
and undying affection for him.  When they entered the
house, their discourse was interrupted by the sounds of
violence and cries of terror that issued from the streets.
The Roman soldiers had rushed down from the temple,
and were slaying all whom they could overtake.  The
houses on every side were in flames; and it was only
the presence of the troops who were stationed in the
court, that had preserved the noble dwelling of Zadok
from pillage and destruction.  But the conflagration was
spreading around, and ere long the fire must reach the
building.  It was no longer a safe retreat for Naomi;
and Marcellus determined to convey her and Deborah,
without loss of time, beyond the walls of the city to some
place of security.  He hastily prepared a litter; and
having carefully concealed Naomi and her attendant
from the eyes of the now ungovernable soldiery who
paraded the streets, he caused his men to bear it towards
the water-gate, while he and Theophilus guarded it
with drawn swords on each side.  It was with considerable
difficulty and frequent opposition from the excited
legionaries, that they succeeded in reaching the gate.
The guards appointed to defend it had fled, and they
passed out into the desolate valley, once verdant with
gardens and orchards.  When Naomi knew that she was
beyond the reach of danger, she withdrew the drapery
that surrounded her, and looked around on the scenes
so familiar and so dear.  All was changed; not a vestige
remained of what had been so beautiful and luxuriant,
and the red light of the burning city fell only on a
barren desert.  The valley was traversed, and Marcellus
with his companions reached the Roman camp at the
north of the city, as the first rays of morning dawned
on the work of destruction that had been accomplished
in the preceding night.  In his father's tent he
established Naomi and Deborah; and leaving them to the
care of Theophilus, he returned again to the city, and
joined his commander.
</p>

<p>
The whole Roman army encamped that day in the
sacred precincts of the temple, and planted their
victorious eagles among the smoking ruins.  A sacrifice
was offered to their false deities in the sanctuary of the
Lord of Hosts, and loud acclamations proclaimed the
victory of Titus.  The immense value of the spoils with
which each soldier was enriched, greatly increased their
joy: so vast was the amount of the treasures they had
obtained, that gold became as brass among these soldiers.
In the midst of their loud rejoicings, their attention was
attracted by the sight of a small party of priests and
others on the top of a wall to which they had escaped.
For five days these miserable beings remained in that
situation, until starvation induced them to come down
and implore for mercy.  Isaac, the cruel, hard-hearted
Isaac, was among them; and he entreated for life with
an abject fear that excited the scorn of the Romans.  It
was unavailing, Titus would not listen to their
supplications, and they were immediately executed.
</p>

<p>
A number of the Zealots had escaped to the upper
city with their leader, and there they still defied the
Romans.  There were numerous and extensive subterranean
passages beneath that part of the city; and the
hopes of the insurgents rested in these for their
preservation.  It would be a repetition of scenes already
described to narrate the sufferings of those who were
cooped up within the walls of Sion.  All the miseries of
a second siege were endured; and it was not until the
7th of September that the Romans ascended the wall
with shouts of triumph, and rushed through the streets,
slaying and destroying as they went.  But little plunder
was found in this quarter: the houses were filled with
putrid bodies of whole families who had died of hunger;
and after gazing on the massy towers and walls of which
he was now the master, Titus gave orders that the whole
city should be razed to the ground and utterly destroyed,
except three towers, which were left standing as monuments
of the conquest.
</p>

<p>
The multitude of prisoners was embarrassing to the
conquerors; and after a selection had been made of the
tallest and most powerful-looking of the insurgents, to
grace the triumphal return of Titus to the capital, a vast
number of these rebels were put to death.  The old and
infirm, both of men and women, shared the same fate;
and of the rest of the prisoners, many thousands were
sent to the mines in various parts of the empire, or
distributed among the provinces to fight as gladiators for
the amusement of the populace.  The number of the
captives amounted to ninety-seven thousand; of those
who were slain or died of famine throughout the siege
the number has been computed at no less than our
million one hundred thousand!
</p>

<p>
Still the chief objects of search to the Roman soldiers,
and those on whom they especially thirsted to glut their
vengeance, seemed to elude their pursuit.  Neither John
of Gischala nor the son of Gioras was to be found amid
the ruins of the city.  John had sought refuge in the
subterranean caverns, with a multitude of his adherents.
The Romans discovered the entrance to some of these
caves, and endeavoured to penetrate them, but the
pestilential effluvia that proceeded from the putrid corpses
that choked the passages drove them back.  At length
John, and his brothers who had followed him to his
retreat, came forth, reduced by starvation, and
surrendered to the victors on a promise of mercy.  This
promise was performed, and the atrocious John was
spared, but condemned to perpetual imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
It was supposed that Simon had expired in one of the
caverns, and the search was suspended.  Titus prepared
to leave the ruined city, and Marcellus rejoiced that at
length he might remove his beloved Naomi from a scene
where every object that met her view was a memorial
of former happiness and recent calamity.  The fate of
her brother weighed heavily on her mind; there was
no hope of his being yet alive; but every search that
Marcellus had caused to be made for his body had proved
ineffectual, and Naomi was forced to leave the place in
uncertainty whether he had perished or been sent off to
the provinces as a captive.  She was treated by Rufus
with the kindest attention, and everything was done by
those around her to reconcile her to her situation; but
her heart had been too severely wounded to recover
its natural strength and elasticity thus early.  She had
much to lament, as well as much to be grateful for; and
Marcellus did not love her less because she was
frequently so much absorbed in her melancholy reflections
as to be insensible even to the pleasure of his society.
She remained entirely secluded with Deborah in Rufus's
tent, or travelled, concealed in a litter, until the army
arrived at Cæsarea, on the coast, where Titus paused for
some time before he proceeded to Cæsarea Philippi.
Marcellus then applied for leave of absence for himself
and his father, that they might escort Naomi to her
friends at Ephesus, and the permission was readily
obtained.  Happily a vessel was in the port, bound for
Ephesus, and in this they all embarked, and sailed away
from the desolated land of Judea, towards the spot where
Naomi and Theophilus hoped to meet all their surviving
relatives, and to be once more united to those so dear to
them both.
</p>

<p>
After their departure a messenger arrived at Cæsarea
from the ruined metropolis, with intelligence that Simon
and one of his officers had been discovered.  A party
of the Roman soldiers who were left encamped in the
ruined city had been startled one day as they were
reposing amid the blackened and tottering walls of
the temple, by seeing a man of dignified appearance,
and clothed in a rich robe of purple, over a white
garment, rise suddenly among them, as if from the
earth.  At the first moment their superstitious fears
led them to believe that it was a spectre, but on their
demanding the name of the apparition, he replied,
"Simon, the son of Gioras."
</p>

<p>
He had descended a secret passage on the total defeat
of his party, and with several others had remained
concealed ever since that time.  The provisions which
they had taken with them had failed, and none of
his companions remained alive except Javan, who
followed his chief from their retreat, and they both
surrendered themselves into the hands of Terentius
Rufus, who held the command of the troops remaining
at Jerusalem.  Simon had hoped to overawe the guard
by his sudden and mysterious appearance, and thus to
effect his escape; but in this hope he was disappointed
and found himself a captive in the hands of his enemies.
This news was most welcome to Titus, and he dispatched
immediate orders that the son of Gioras should
be sent with his comrade to join him at Cæsarea, and
assist to swell the honour of his triumph.
</p>

<p>
The domes and pinnacles of Diana's far-famed temple
were glowing in the ruddy beams of the setting sun,
when the white sails of a vessel were descried from the
watch-towers of Ephesus, bearing swiftly and steadily
towards the port.  It was known by the signals hoisted
from the masthead to be a merchant-ship returning
from Syria, and numbers of the inhabitants of the city
assembled on the quays and the banks of the river to
witness the arrival of the goodly vessel, and hear from
the passengers the latest intelligence of the war in
Judea.  Among those who waited most anxiously for
the approach of the ship to the landing-place, were
Amaziah and his wife, with their adopted daughter
Claudia.  They hoped to receive some communication
from their beloved friends in Jerusalem, or at least a
letter from Marcellus, telling of the state of the
metropolis.  Possibly some of their countrymen might have
escaped from the beleaguered city, and from them they
should hear of the welfare of those so deeply interesting
to them all.
</p>

<p>
A favourable breeze filled the sails of the vessel, and
it cut through the yielding waters with the grace and
rapidity of a water-bird, and yet the motion seemed too
slow for the anxious impatience of the Jewish exiles.
They wandered to and fro along the margin of the river,
to the point of land where the broad stream fell into the
bosom of the ocean, and again returned to the
landing-place.  The daylight died away before the ship had
entered the mouth of the river, and ere it reached the
quay its tall mast and lofty prow could hardly be
distinguished in the increasing darkness.  But lights were
hoisted from the rigging, and gleamed on the crowded
deck, and the rush of the parting waters told that the
noble bark was coming gallantly against the stream.
Many torches were brought down to the shore, and
their waving and flickering light fell on the anxious and
strongly-marked Jewish features of Amaziah and Judith,
and the fairer countenance of their young companion.
The anchor was cast out, the ropes were thrown on
shore, and the vessel lay steadily against the marble steps
of the quay.  What voice was that so wild and shrill
that sounded from the shore above all the murmuring
of the assembled crowd?  That pale and delicate girl
who stood by the side of Amaziah, and leant upon his
arm, had cast her tearful eyes upon the deck of the
vessel, and in the midst of the groups of passengers she
had discerned a form that seemed the vision of one long
dead and deeply mourned.
</p>

<p>
She clung to the arm of Amaziah, and pointed convulsively
to the deck, while her large blue eyes were
dilated with astonishment and fear, and her parted
lips refused to utter the name so dear and so familiar
to them.  Judith and her husband looked in vain for
the cause of Claudia's agitation.  The form which had
conjured up such wild emotions had disappeared among
the crowd, and gradually she became convinced that it
had been a creature of her imagination, and that the
image for ever present to her heart had caused the
startling fancy.  Her extended hand fell down again,
and with a deep drawn and shivering sigh she faintly
whispered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was a blissful, but a cruel deception!"
</p>

<p>
"What was it, my child?" asked Judith.  "Did you
see any countenance that recalled the memory of the
friends we left in Judea?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mother, yes; I thought I saw those features
that haunt my sleeping hours, and seem to smile upon
from the skies by day.  They looked more like those
of a living man than the angelic face that visits my
dreams, and my foolish heart was startled.  But ah! it is
there again!  Look, Judith, look at the side of the
vessel;&mdash;and another form is there!  O God of mercy,
let not my bewildered brain thus mock me with such
fancies!  They come&mdash;they come on!  They have
stepped upon the quay!  Oh, those are no forms of air.
Take me, Amaziah, take me to meet them, and let me
find it true, or die!"
</p>

<p>
Judith and Amaziah were hardly less agitated than
their companion.  They likewise saw the figures that
passed from the deck to the shore, and they likewise
knew not how to trust their eyes.  But the breathless
suspense soon terminated in a blissful reality, and they
embraced the living forms of their lamented son and
their beloved Naomi.  It would be vain to attempt to
paint the feelings of that group, whose hearts were filled
to overflowing with so many and powerful emotions.  It
was not for some moments that the presence of Marcellus
and his father was perceived, but then they were warmly
and joyfully greeted; and then came the inquiries after
Zadok and Salome, who were supposed to have sent
away their daughter, and to have remained themselves
to witness the fate of their country.  Rufus quickly
replied, and silenced all further questions; while the tears
of Naomi plainly told that she had not abandoned her
native land until she was a lonely orphan.
</p>

<p>
The house which Amaziah occupied was not far distant
from the banks of the river; and when the party
so unexpectedly united were assembled in the pillared
verandah, many hours were passed in sweet discourse
though deeply tinged with melancholy recollections, and
recitals of sufferings and trials that never could be
effaced from the heart.  But hope, and faith, and
resignation shed their happy influence over that family
group, and deep gratitude was seated in every heart, for
the mercies that were so bountifully mingled with their
afflictions.  Rufus was a heathen amid a family of
Christians.  Would he remain hardened in idolatry
when he saw the blessed fruits of a purer religion so
beautifully displayed around him?
</p>

<p>
Some weeks had elapsed since the arrival of the
merchant-ship, and the bitterness of Naomi's feelings
had begun in some measure to subside, when Rufus
announced that he could no longer tarry at Ephesus,
but must take advantage of a ship which he found was
shortly to sail for Rome, and return to the capital to meet
Titus, and share in the glories of his triumphant entry.
Marcellus had obtained permission to absent himself, and
he gladly relinquished his share in the honours of the
magnificent but somewhat barbarous ceremony that was
expected.  He however urgently joined in the request of
his father, that Naomi would consent to their marriage
taking place before the departure of the latter, and that
the union of Claudia and Theophilus might be celebrated
at the same time.  Naomi's heart was still too much
oppressed with the remembrance of the sad scenes she
had so recently witnessed, to enable her to feel that it
was a time for the accomplishment of all her hopes of
earthly happiness; but she yielded to the solicitations of
all her friends, and an early day was fixed for the nuptials.
The benediction was pronounced on the two young
couples in the church consecrated to the service of Christ;
and the hands of the venerable Christian bishop were
laid on their heads as they knelt devoutly before the
altar.  Many of the Ephesian converts and exiled
disciples from Judea were present at the sacred ceremony;
and all were deeply interested in the two lovely maidens
who after so much suffering and so many heavy trials,
which they had borne with exemplary fortitude, at length
were rewarded with as much of happiness as they could
hope to possess on earth.
</p>

<p>
Rufus took leave of his children and departed for
Rome, with a promise that he would return to visit them
at Ephesus, when his presence was no longer required
with the army.  This promise he was unable to fulfil
until the following spring, when once again he joined
the happy family&mdash;and this time he did not come alone.
He was accompanied by a man, who, though still young
in years, bore the deep furrows of toil and suffering,
and uncontrolled passions, on his pale cheek and lofty
brow.  That brow wore less of pride, and those dark
eyes glanced less fiercely than they were wont to do, for
captivity and disappointed hopes had humbled the heart
that once burned with ambition, and beat with a thirst
for vengeance.  Tears of softened and natural feeling
flowed down his cheeks as he clasped Naomi in his arms
and extended his hand to her husband and to Theophilus.
It was Javan.  Rufus had found him in slavery at Rome,
and with a generosity that was worthy of a Christian, he
had forgotten all past injuries, and redeemed the proud
young Pharisee from the servitude that galled his spirit.
The chastisements of the Lord had not been altogether
thrown away upon him.  He never forgot his native
land, or ceased to mourn her degradation; but it was
not with the wrathful bitterness that once preyed on his
heart; for he learned to regard her afflictions as the just
retribution of her crimes, and to look for her restitution
to glory when that Jesus whose name he had so often
blasphemed, shall come in the clouds of heaven, with all
his holy angels, to sit on the throne of David, and reign
over his people for ever.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
